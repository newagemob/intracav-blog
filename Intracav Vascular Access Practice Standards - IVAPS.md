# Adverse Event Management and Reporting

Effective adverse event management is fundamental to patient safety and quality improvement in infusion therapy. This section establishes comprehensive standards for identifying, documenting, investigating, and learning from adverse events, serious adverse events, and near-miss incidents associated with vascular access devices and infusion therapy.

### Core Principles

Healthcare organizations must establish robust systems for adverse event management that prioritize patient safety, promote transparency, and support continuous learning. The foundation of this approach rests on understanding human error and system failures within the broader science of safety, as defined through organizational policies and procedures.

All adverse events, serious adverse events (including sentinel events), and close calls associated with infusion therapy or vascular access devices must be comprehensively documented within the patient health record, reported through organizational reporting systems, and communicated to appropriate regulatory bodies when required.

### Documentation and Identification Standards

Healthcare organizations should implement standardized tools to identify, document, and track adverse events in accordance with institutional policy. Documentation must be objective and fact-based, avoiding subjective interpretations or assumptions. Standardized reporting forms and electronic systems facilitate consistent data collection and enable meaningful analysis of trends and patterns.

Patient and caregiver education represents a critical component of early adverse event detection. Clinical staff should educate patients and caregivers about signs and symptoms of complications, reactions, or untoward events that could indicate an adverse event. Patients must receive clear instructions on how to contact appropriate clinicians—whether home care nurses or ambulatory clinic staff—for timely management of concerning symptoms.

## Reporting Requirements and Pathways

Adverse events and close calls must be reported through multiple channels within defined timeframes established by organizational and regulatory requirements. The reporting pathway includes multiple stakeholders and organizations, each serving distinct roles in the safety ecosystem.

### Internal Reporting Pathways

Within healthcare organizations, adverse events must be communicated to the patient's provider and essential healthcare team members, organizational management personnel, and relevant departments such as risk management and quality improvement. This internal cascade ensures comprehensive awareness and enables coordinated response to safety concerns.

### External Reporting Requirements

Beyond internal reporting, organizations must report to advisory organizations such as the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP), regulatory bodies including the FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database, and relevant international regulatory agencies such as Health Canada, the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) in Germany, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United Kingdom, Swissmedic in Switzerland, and the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (Anvisa).

Accreditation organizations—including The Joint Commission, Joint Commission International, Healthcare Facilities Accreditation Program, Det Norske Veritas, Community Health Accreditation Partner, and Accreditation Commission for Health Care—must receive reports in accordance with institutional policy and accreditation standards. When product defects contribute to adverse events, organizations should retain the defective device and return it to the manufacturer as part of the product incident report.

## Investigation and Root Cause Analysis

Serious adverse events require thorough investigation to ensure prompt corrective action and sustained safety improvement. Organizations must establish clear processes to determine which serious events require formal root cause analysis (RCA). This systematic investigation methodology aims to understand not just what happened, but why it happened and how similar events can be prevented.

### Components of Effective Investigation

The investigation process begins with comprehensive description and analysis of the event and contributing factors to discern root causes. Investigators should examine the full context surrounding the event, including environmental factors, system issues, human factors, and equipment performance. The analysis must extend beyond individual actions to identify systemic vulnerabilities that enabled the adverse event.

Following analysis, organizations must implement specific strategies and actions for improvement that actively protect patients. An interprofessional approach to patient safety proves most effective, encompassing systems issues, procedures, human resources, peer and clinical review, products and equipment, processes, and training gaps. Research has identified eight domains of patient safety associated with improved outcomes: transformational leadership, patient engagement, human resources management quality, innovation technology, skill competency, education in patient safety, teamwork, and effective communication.

Clinical staff should actively participate in the development, implementation, and evaluation of improvement plans arising from investigations. For complex or recurrent problems, and for near-miss events, organizations should employ systematic investigation or analysis methodologies. Aggregate analysis of serious events can identify organization-specific trends affecting multiple incidents, revealing patterns that single-event analysis might miss.

## Building a Culture of Safety

Effective safety improvement requires more than incident investigation—it demands a prevention-focused organizational culture. This culture emphasizes shared learning, high reliability, and systematic approaches to safety enhancement.

**Just Culture Principles**

Organizations must focus on correcting systems and processes rather than blaming individual clinicians. This approach, known as just culture, examines at-risk behaviors and coaches individuals to make safe behavioral choices while maintaining appropriate accountability. Just culture distinguishes between human error (which requires system improvement), at-risk behavior (which requires coaching), and reckless behavior (which may require disciplinary action).

**Teamwork and Communication Enhancement**

Organizations should advocate for teamwork interventions including comprehensive training and education focused on communication and leadership, work redesign to change interactions through mechanisms like interprofessional rounds or team huddles, implementation of structured tools and protocols such as handoff communication tools and checklists, and sustained management support for safety initiatives.

**Systematic Safety Methods**

Healthcare Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (HFMEA) provides a systematic method to guide safety initiatives. This proactive approach identifies potential failure modes before adverse events occur, enabling preventive action. Organizations should standardize and simplify reporting processes throughout the organization to reduce barriers to incident reporting and ensure that recommendations from investigations are monitored for implementation and effectiveness.

Clinical staff should include patient safety discussions in rounds to identify and report adverse events promptly. This regular attention to safety reinforces its priority and enables early detection of concerning trends.

## Transparency and Disclosure

Organizations must establish a culture that promotes safety transparency, encourages reporting, and empowers clinicians to identify and implement appropriate actions to prevent adverse events and close calls. This transparency extends to patients and families through responsible disclosure of errors.

Healthcare teams should ensure responsible disclosure of errors to patients, caregivers, or surrogates, promoting interprofessional collaboration in planning and discussing information with the team responsible for disclosure. When appropriate, patients, caregivers, or surrogates should be included in adverse event review, recognizing their valuable perspective and supporting their recovery from the harm experienced.

Organizations must communicate necessary practice changes to staff at all levels, ensuring that lessons learned translate into sustained improvements across the organization. This communication should be clear, consistent, and reinforced through multiple channels.

## Supporting Healthcare Workers

Healthcare organizations must recognize and support the "second victims"—clinicians who experience emotional trauma following involvement in an adverse patient event or unintentional healthcare error. These healthcare workers may experience significant psychological distress, including anxiety, depression, reduced professional confidence, and post-traumatic stress.

Organizations should implement formal support programs for second victims, providing access to peer support, professional counseling, and resources for emotional recovery. This support acknowledges that clinicians who care deeply about their patients may be profoundly affected when adverse events occur, even when system factors beyond their control contributed to the outcome.

## Staffing and Competency

Research consistently demonstrates that adequate staffing and appropriate skill levels correlate with reduced adverse events. Organizations must identify the levels of clinical knowledge and skills necessary to reduce adverse events and ensure appropriate staffing levels to support safe care delivery. Evidence shows that fewer adverse events are documented when organizations maintain adequate staffing ratios and support ongoing competency development.

# Product Management and Device Safety

Effective product management ensures that vascular access devices, infusion products, and related equipment meet the highest standards of safety, efficacy, and reliability. This section establishes standards for product evaluation, selection, monitoring, and incident reporting to protect patients and support optimal clinical outcomes.

## Product Evaluation and Selection

Clinical end users must be actively involved in evaluating vascular access devices and infusion products, equipment, and technologies. This evaluation should assess multiple dimensions including clinical application, performance, infection and complication prevention, safety, efficacy, ease of use, acceptability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness.

**Interprofessional Product Evaluation Teams**

Organizations should include an interprofessional group of direct and indirect clinician end users in the product evaluation process. This group should encompass nurses, infection preventionists, physicians, biomedical engineers, information technologists, pharmacists, and patient representatives. This diverse composition ensures comprehensive assessment from multiple perspectives relevant to product performance and safety.

Products should be selected for evaluation based on organizational quality indicators, internally and externally reported incident, occurrence, or adverse event reports, availability of new or safer products, current and emerging evidence, and developing technologies. This data-driven approach ensures that evaluation efforts focus on products most likely to impact patient safety and clinical outcomes.

**Environmental Considerations**

When selecting devices, teams must assess factors specific to the intended setting. For home care environments, evaluation should determine whether the device is designed for that unique environment, whether reusable equipment can be properly cleaned and disinfected between uses, whether the product provides adequate feedback to assist patients and caregivers in identifying and troubleshooting problems, and whether the product or technology will improve communication between home care patients and the healthcare team.

**Establishing Clear Evaluation Goals**

Organizations must establish clear goals for product evaluation, defining in advance what will be measured and what minimum parameters must be met for the evaluation to be considered successful. Goals might include enhancing continuity of care, reducing specific complications, improving clinician compliance with best practices, saving time, or standardizing use across the organization.

Risk-benefit analysis should guide product selection, comparing patient risk for injury against indications for use. Evaluation teams must understand the intended organizational use of products—such as reduction of infection, occlusion, or thrombosis—and compare this against manufacturer directions for use and product indications. Teams should develop data collection tools for analysis and ongoing monitoring, and provide comprehensive education and training for use of selected products, potentially involving manufacturer support in product education.

## Ongoing Knowledge and Competency

Clinical end users must attain and maintain current knowledge about developments and technologies relating to vascular access devices, infusion products, and equipment. This ongoing education ensures that clinical practice aligns with evidence-based recommendations and that staff can effectively utilize new technologies and products as they become available.

## Product Inspection and Quality Assurance

All infusion and vascular access equipment and supplies must be inspected for product integrity and function before, during, and after use. This systematic inspection process protects patients from product defects and enables early detection of quality issues.

**Pre-Use Inspection Protocol**

Before use, products must be visually inspected for damage to ensure that packaging is clean, dry, and intact. Staff should verify that the product expiration date has not passed. Any product failing these criteria should be removed from clinical use immediately.

**Management of Expired or Defective Products**

Expired or defective products must be removed from patient use and clearly labeled as such. The defect or expiration must be reported to the appropriate department within the organization, to the manufacturer, and to authoritative reporting organizations as required. When possible, defective devices should be retained and returned to the manufacturer as part of the product incident report to enable thorough investigation of the failure mode.

## Problem Reporting and Investigation

Healthcare organizations must establish robust systems for reporting and investigating problems associated with medical devices. Clinical staff should monitor for product recalls and hazard alerts, staying informed about known issues with products in use within their organization.

**Structured Investigation Approach**

When investigating problems associated with medical devices, organizations should use a structured and objective approach. Issues may include device malfunction, user error, or problems with surrounding infrastructure. Investigation should identify whether additional clinician education is needed versus whether compliance and accountability require review. This distinction guides appropriate corrective action.

**Creating a Reporting-Conducive Environment**

Organizations must develop an environment conducive to reporting device problems. Research shows that clinicians may switch to different devices or develop workarounds to continue using problematic products, and may be uncertain about what to report or fearful of incident reporting consequences. Organizations should explore systems to facilitate ease of reporting, including electronic error reporting mechanisms, and contribute to medical device surveillance programs to increase patient safety and promote manufacturer accountability.

All adverse events or serious adverse events associated with vascular access devices or infusion products and equipment must be reported to appropriate departments within the organization—such as risk management and quality improvement—and to authoritative reporting organizations as required. This reporting aligns with the broader adverse event management framework.

## Supply Chain Disruption Management

Clinical experts must participate in product substitution decisions required during supply chain disruptions. When familiar products become unavailable and substitutions are necessary, organizations must ensure comprehensive planning for communication, education, and outcome monitoring to maintain patient safety during transitions.

# Controlled Substance Diversion Prevention

Drug diversion \- the unauthorized redirection of controlled substances from legitimate medical purposes \- poses significant risks to patient safety, healthcare worker wellbeing, and public health. This section establishes comprehensive standards for preventing, recognizing, and responding to controlled substance diversion in healthcare settings.

## Organizational Framework and Culture

Organizations that procure, dispense, handle, or administer controlled substances must establish comprehensive policies, procedures, and processes ensuring proper management throughout the entire medication pathway. This framework must be supported by an organizational culture of safety that promotes prompt reporting and confidential, nonpunitive investigation of suspected diversion.

All healthcare team members with access to controlled substances require role-specific training and demonstrated competency in processes related to controlled substance handling and use. Each controlled substance administration must be accompanied by a valid order from an authorized prescriber, ensuring medical necessity and appropriate documentation.

## Comprehensive Diversion Prevention Program

Healthcare organizations should implement a comprehensive Controlled Substance Diversion Prevention (CSDP) program to optimize patient safety during procurement, dispensing, handling, and administration of controlled substances. This program empowers healthcare workers and leadership to implement strategies creating a safe, healthy work environment.

**Professional Standards and Expectations**

Organizations must establish clear expectations for professional behaviors and norms that discourage abuse of controlled substances. These expectations should be communicated during orientation and reinforced regularly through education and leadership modeling.

**Policy and Procedure Development**

Policies and procedures must accurately reflect local and regional regulatory requirements in all aspects of controlled substance management. This includes consistent monitoring of procurement, storage, dispensing, handling, administration, and waste processes, supported by clear communication structures. Organizations should establish collaboration with key stakeholders including pharmacy, providers, nursing, local law enforcement officials, vendors, healthcare leaders, infection prevention, contracted services, risk management, human resources, and biomedical engineering to ensure that the diversion prevention program is comprehensive and effective.

**Chain of Custody**

Organizations must maintain a secure chain of custody for controlled substances throughout the medication pathway. This may include use of locked devices when transporting controlled substances from pharmacy to unit-based storage units. Organizations should establish consistent surveillance processes through collaboration with interprofessional teams in selecting and effectively utilizing technology for controlled substance management.

Automated dispensing cabinets and medication-related automated systems require initial and ongoing staff training and competency verification, regular validation of proper user access, regular review of override lists, ongoing system maintenance, and established downtime procedures. Organizations should consider establishing interoperability between medication storage units and electronic health records to improve system support and detection capabilities.

**Investigation and System Improvement**

Organizations must develop interprofessional processes to conduct thorough investigation of each suspected or confirmed diversion event to determine potential for system improvements. Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) can identify vulnerabilities through the entire medication pathway, enabling proactive prevention strategies. All infusion devices must operate according to manufacturer specifications to prevent tampering or unauthorized access.

## Prevention Strategies

**Opioid Stewardship**

Organizations should establish opioid stewardship programs to optimize dosing, provide multimodal pain relief, and educate patients and caregivers on diversion prevention. These programs should develop specific processes to prevent diversion in home care and hospice settings, including proper controlled substance waste procedures and screening of patients and caregivers for history of addiction or risk of misuse where controlled substances are in use.

Organizations should recognize the particular risk posed by immediate-release opioids that may be converted to non-oral routes and investigate abuse-deterrent formulation preparations of oral opioids to reduce diversion potential.

**Pre-Employment Screening**

Organizations should implement pre-employment background checks for healthcare workers with access to controlled substances. This screening helps identify individuals who may pose elevated risk for diversion.

**Order Review and Prescribing Practices**

Clinical staff should review orders for controlled substances carefully for accuracy and appropriateness for individual patients. Organizations should use electronic prescribing of controlled substances and minimize use of paper prescriptions. When paper prescriptions are required, prescription pads must be secured to ensure that only authorized individuals have access.

**Access Control**

Organizations must limit access to controlled substances through restricted storage access using keys, biometrics, or badge access systems. High-risk and high-volume areas where diversion may occur should be identified to facilitate increased surveillance and control of the medication pathway. Organizations should consider camera surveillance for high-risk areas as an additional deterrent and detection mechanism.

Chain of custody must always be maintained throughout the medication management process. Controlled substances removed from main medication storage must be stored in secured, locked receptacles accessible only to authorized staff. Organizations must ensure processes to maintain chain of custody of keys when used to access and administer controlled substances, including locked boxes, refrigerated storage, and infusion pumps. Authorized staff must not delegate their access to controlled substances in ways that alter chain of custody. Organizations must ensure security of controlled substances that patients bring into facilities or that arrive with patients transferred from other facilities.

**Education and Training**

Organizations must conduct controlled substance diversion education for all personnel with access to these medications, including unlicensed and contracted personnel, at initial orientation and regularly thereafter. This education should cover responsibility to protect public safety; risk factors for substance use disorder, addiction, and diversion; signs, symptoms, and patterns of behavior that may indicate diversion; medications at high risk for diversion; preventative measures in place in the organization; proper documentation processes for all controlled substance transactions; processes used to conduct diversion investigations; potential for civil and criminal penalties if diversion is confirmed; and potential for disciplinary actions for failure to report suspected diversion.

Healthcare education programs for providers, pharmacists, and nurses should integrate curriculum regarding prevention and recognition of controlled substance diversion, preparing future practitioners to participate effectively in diversion prevention efforts.

**Administration Process Compliance**

Organizations should ensure compliance with approved controlled substance administration processes. Controlled substances should be stocked in ready-to-administer form in the lowest available units typically prescribed to patients to limit volume required to be wasted. Preparation should occur as close to administration time as possible, with organizations identifying optimal time allowed from controlled substance removal to administration.

Dose preparation should be limited to single doses when possible. If sequential dosing is delivered from a single syringe, organizations must ensure methods exist to accurately track and document delivery. When delays occur between preparation and administration, chain of custody must be maintained. Syringes containing controlled substances should be labeled per organization policy if not immediately used, and control of the medication maintained at all times. Continuous infusions or patient-controlled controlled substances should be administered through secure devices that do not allow access or tampering.

**Waste Management**

Organizations must ensure proper adherence to controlled substance waste processes for unused medications. Waste should occur at medication removal or promptly after administration within an established timeframe. An independent witness must physically watch and validate the accuracy of volume or dose of medication to be wasted. All waste receptacles must be secured and tracked, and controlled substances must be disposed of in a manner that renders them irretrievable and unusable. Organizations should consider utilizing waste products that convert controlled substances to nonretrievable states and are allowable for landfill waste.

Organizations must establish processes for controlled substance tracking with prompt resolution of medications that are expired, unusable, returned, or subject to loss of chain of custody.

## Recognition and Detection

Early recognition of potential diversion protects patients from harm and enables timely intervention for healthcare workers experiencing substance use disorders. Organizations must establish cultures that communicate each employee's obligation to recognize and promptly, anonymously report behaviors that may be associated with diversion.

**Drug Testing and Technology**

Organizations should implement drug testing as appropriate to detect potential diversion and impaired practice according to local jurisdiction and governing boards. Waste-testing technology may be considered to detect saline replacement of controlled substances as a diversion tactic.

**Discrepancy Investigation**

Organizations must promptly investigate and resolve controlled substance discrepancies. Routine audits of aspects of the medication pathway should be conducted to detect potential diversion. These audits should review prescribing practices for patterns that may indicate potential diversion, identify system-generated reports and processes to investigate patterns and trends of medication retrieval as allowed by technology, review documentation for accuracy and unusual patterns, and review patient response to documented medication delivery and pain management trends to identify potential deviations in actual medication delivery compared to documented administration.

Organizations should be aware that false-positive reports may occur in system-generated reports and should be investigated carefully. Research suggests that medication administration timing discrepancies may be more accurate than reports based on standard deviation. Organizations should consider monitoring the pathway of high-risk medications such as propofol that have increased risk of diversion but do not have controlled substance designation.

**Immediate Response to Impairment**

Organizations must implement processes to rapidly remove healthcare workers suspected of being impaired from patient care delivery, preventing access to controlled substances while investigation is conducted. This immediate action protects both patients and the affected healthcare worker.

**Regulatory Reporting**

Confirmed diversion and unaccounted loss of controlled substances must be reported to proper entities in accordance with licensing, local laws, and regulations. Organizations must establish systems and processes to rapidly identify and manage infectious outbreaks that may be due to controlled substance diversion, as contaminated substances pose serious infection risks to patients.

## Recovery and Return to Practice

Healthcare organizations must establish processes to support the confidentiality and recovery of healthcare workers experiencing substance abuse disorders. Alternative-to-discipline programs that implement evidence-based strategies have been associated with increased success in supporting recovery and enabling healthcare workers to return to practice safely.

Organizations should establish cultures that regard substance use and addiction as chronic illnesses, with clear goals of retention, rehabilitation, and reentry into practice when appropriate. This approach recognizes that healthcare workers experiencing substance use disorders require treatment and support rather than solely punitive responses.

Organizations must establish processes to monitor the practice of healthcare workers returning to the workforce after recovery to assure that patient safety is protected. This monitoring provides appropriate oversight while supporting successful reintegration into clinical practice.

# Latex Allergy and Sensitivity Management

Latex allergy and sensitivity pose significant health risks to both healthcare workers and patients. This section establishes standards for minimizing latex exposure, identifying at-risk individuals, and managing allergic reactions in healthcare settings.

## Core Principles

Healthcare organizations must minimize latex exposure in the environment and provide personal protective equipment, patient care equipment, and supplies manufactured without natural rubber latex to latex-sensitive or latex-allergic clinicians and patients. These latex-free alternatives must be used consistently during patient care to prevent sensitization and allergic reactions.

## Identification of At-Risk Individuals

**Healthcare Providers**

Organizations must identify healthcare providers with latex allergy or sensitivity. Exposure to latex gloves represents the most common cause of latex allergy and sensitivity in healthcare workers. Regular screening and prompt identification enable appropriate accommodations and prevent progression from sensitivity to allergy.

**Patient Populations**

Healthcare providers must identify patients at increased risk for or with known latex allergy or sensitivity. High-risk patient populations include children with birth defects, neurologic and genitourinary disorders, or populations with diseases requiring multiple surgical procedures and indwelling urinary catheters, particularly those with history of atopy.

Patients with myelomeningocele face particularly elevated risk, especially those who have undergone more than five surgical procedures. Research demonstrates that patients with allergies to tropical fruits and some vegetables—including avocado, banana, chestnut, kiwi, and tomato—have high cross-reactivity to latex, as these fruits and vegetables contain proteins with allergenic similarities to latex. Approximately fifty percent of patients with latex allergies will have reactions to one or more fruits and vegetables containing similar proteins.

## Documentation and Communication

Organizations must document and communicate positive screens for latex sensitivity or allergy in the patient health record so all healthcare providers involved in patient care can incorporate appropriate precautions into the care plan. This documentation should be prominently displayed and easily accessible to prevent inadvertent latex exposure during care delivery.

## Clinical Recognition and Education

Healthcare organizations must educate clinicians in recognizing and treating the distinct presentations of latex sensitivity versus latex allergy. Understanding these differences enables appropriate clinical response and prevents progression from sensitivity to allergy.

**Latex Sensitivity (Allergic Contact Dermatitis)**

Latex sensitivity manifests as a type IV immunologic reaction, representing a delayed T cell-mediated reaction to chemicals used in latex manufacturing. Clinical presentation begins with acute eczema-like skin rash, vesicles, and pruritus, erythema, or hives. With continued exposure to latex, sensitivity can progress to latex allergy, making prevention of ongoing exposure critical.

**Latex Allergy (Type I Hypersensitivity)**

Latex allergy represents type I immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity reactions that occur within minutes of exposure to latex. Reactions range from mild presentations including urticaria and rhinoconjunctivitis to severe manifestations such as bronchospasm, hypotension, and anaphylaxis. The rapid onset and potential severity of type I reactions require immediate recognition and treatment.

Research demonstrates that sublingual immunotherapy has been effective in decreasing severity of reactions in sensitized individuals, providing a potential treatment option for patients with established latex allergy.

## Exposure Routes and Prevention

Healthcare workers must recognize potential exposure routes to latex including direct skin contact, airborne exposure (largely reduced with powder-free gloves), and food or medicine contamination from medical devices and medication vials. Understanding these diverse exposure routes enables comprehensive prevention strategies.

**Glove Selection and Use**

Organizations should use non-powdered, non-latex gloves as standard practice. The transition to non-powdered latex and synthetic gloves has resulted in dramatic reduction in sensitization rates. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has banned the use of powdered surgeon's gloves, powdered patient examination gloves, and absorbable powder for lubricating surgeon's gloves, reflecting the significant risk posed by powdered latex products.

**Environmental Management**

Organizations must minimize exposure to latex for individuals at risk or with known latex allergy or sensitivity, as frequent exposure to latex remains the primary cause of sensitization. Healthcare workers should review labels on medical devices, equipment, and supplies prior to use for the presence of latex, which represents a component of product labeling required by the FDA.

Latex-containing products should be removed from the patient care setting when treating latex-allergic or latex-sensitive patients to reduce exposure risk. Healthcare providers should recognize that latex products are ubiquitous and that prevention of contact with latex is challenging. Examples of items within homes that may contain latex include balloons, condoms, adhesives, gloves, baby bottle nipples and pacifiers, and toys. Patients and families should be referred to available lists of products that contain latex to support avoidance strategies.

**Medication Vial Management**

Healthcare workers should access medication vials with latex stoppers only once to minimize latex particle introduction into medications. Most multidose vials no longer contain latex, but verification remains important. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides lists of vaccines indicating presence or absence of latex in packaging, including syringes and vials.

**Patient Education**

Organizations must provide comprehensive patient education about how to avoid latex exposure in healthcare settings and daily life. This education should be tailored to individual patient circumstances and potential exposure sources.

## Organizational Planning

Healthcare organizations should consider involving allergists in formation of interprofessional procurement committees to ensure that product selection decisions incorporate allergy expertise and support latex-free care delivery.

## Emergency Preparedness

Patients and clinicians with latex allergy must be instructed in recognizing signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and should wear medical alert bracelets or necklaces. All healthcare providers and caregivers—including teachers and babysitters—must be informed about latex allergies.

Latex-allergic individuals should carry two epinephrine auto-injectors, as approximately twenty percent of patients will require a second dose during anaphylactic reactions. Patients and caregivers must receive comprehensive education on proper use of epinephrine auto-injectors to ensure effective emergency response.

# Hazardous Drug Management

### **1.1 Fundamental Principles**

Safe handling of hazardous drugs requires a comprehensive approach that addresses all points in the chain of custody, from receipt and storage through preparation, administration, and final disposal. The foundation of any hazardous drug safety program rests on compliance with jurisdictional regulations, appropriate use of personal protective equipment, systematic exposure risk reduction, and proper waste management including spill response protocols.

Healthcare organizations must recognize that there is no established safe threshold of exposure for many hazardous drugs. Exposure can occur at any point in the drug's lifecycle and in any care setting, including during receipt of drug shipments, storage operations, compounding procedures, preparation activities, transportation, administration to patients, waste handling, contact with contaminated bodily fluids, environmental cleaning, and spill response. Additionally, healthcare workers may encounter environmental contamination from surfaces and equipment.\[^5\]\[^7\]\[^12\]

### **1.2 Regulatory Framework and Compliance**

Organizations should follow established guidelines for handling hazardous drugs to protect both clinical and non-clinical personnel from unintentional exposure. Compliance with these guidelines may be voluntary or mandatory depending on the jurisdiction.\[^1\]\[^2\] While some countries have comprehensive regulatory frameworks, others rely on professional standards and institutional policies. Healthcare facilities operating in multiple jurisdictions must ensure compliance with the most stringent applicable requirements.

The regulatory landscape for hazardous drug handling varies significantly across countries, with 24 nations surveyed showing diverse approaches to safety requirements and enforcement mechanisms.\[^1\] Organizations should establish internal policies that meet or exceed jurisdictional requirements and regularly review these policies to incorporate emerging evidence and evolving best practices.

### **1.3 Hazardous Drug Identification and Classification**

#### **1.3.1 Compilation of Institutional Hazardous Drug Lists**

Each organization must prepare and distribute a comprehensive list of hazardous drugs used within the facility. This list requires annual review and updates, with immediate revision when new drugs are introduced into the formulary before their first use.\[^3\]\[^4\]\[^5\]\[^6\] The development and maintenance of an accurate hazardous drug list represents a critical safety measure that enables appropriate handling precautions throughout the organization.

The institutional hazardous drug list should be compiled in accordance with the current National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) list of hazardous drugs in healthcare settings. However, organizations must supplement the NIOSH list by consulting additional trustworthy sources to identify hazardous drugs that may be excluded from the NIOSH classification system. This includes radiopharmaceuticals, veterinary drugs used in human applications, and biologic products approved through the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).\[^4\]\[^5\]\[^7\]\[^8\]\[^9\]\[^10\]

For newly approved drugs, particularly first-in-class agents with mechanisms of action suggestive of potential harm from incidental exposure, organizations should adopt a precautionary approach. Until sufficient safety data becomes available to definitively determine hazardous status, these agents should be handled as hazardous drugs to protect healthcare workers from potentially serious exposure.\[^4\]\[^5\]\[^7\]\[^8\]\[^9\]\[^10\]

#### **1.3.2 Risk Categorization**

Hazardous drugs should be categorized according to their hazardous potential to delineate appropriate handling precautions and guide the selection of control measures. NIOSH has established a useful categorization system that divides hazardous drugs into distinct risk groups.\[^10\]

Group 1 includes drugs known to be or probably carcinogenic to humans based on epidemiological studies or animal research. These agents may or may not present additional toxicity risks beyond carcinogenicity, but their cancer-causing potential necessitates stringent handling precautions to prevent any degree of exposure.

Group 2 encompasses drugs that meet NIOSH criteria for classification as hazardous but are not categorized as known or probable carcinogens. These drugs may exhibit reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity, or organ toxicity at low doses in animal studies or treated patients, warranting protective measures during handling despite the absence of confirmed carcinogenic effects.

#### **1.3.3 Labeling Requirements**

All hazardous drugs must be physically labeled at all times with clear identification of the drug name and appropriate hazard warnings. Physical labeling serves as an immediate visual cue to healthcare workers that special handling precautions are required. Where technologically feasible, organizations should also distinguish hazardous drugs electronically within the electronic health record, electronic medication administration record, and infusion pump drug libraries.\[^3\]\[^4\]\[^7\]\[^11\] Electronic flagging provides an additional layer of safety by alerting clinicians to hazardous status during prescribing, order verification, and administration processes.

### **1.4 Exposure Control Programs**

#### **1.4.1 Risk Point Identification**

Organizations must identify all potential risk points for hazardous drug exposure and implement a comprehensive exposure control program. The exposure control program should address every stage of the hazardous drug lifecycle, recognizing that many healthcare settings beyond oncology units handle hazardous medications. Numerous nonantineoplastic drugs possess hazardous properties, and certain antineoplastic drugs are administered for nononcology disease states such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease.\[^5\]\[^7\]\[^12\]

Personnel in all settings who handle hazardous drugs and contaminated waste must be provided with appropriate personal protective equipment and engineering controls to reduce exposure. This includes staff in outpatient infusion centers, home healthcare, hospital pharmacies, physician offices, ambulatory surgery centers, and other non-traditional oncology settings.\[^4\]\[^7\]

#### **1.4.2 Hierarchy of Controls**

Organizations should implement multiple levels of controls to decrease hazardous drug exposure risk, prioritizing the most effective interventions. The hierarchy of controls, ranked from most to least effective, provides a framework for developing comprehensive protection strategies.\[^5\]\[^13\]

Elimination represents the most effective control measure and involves removing the hazard entirely. In the context of hazardous drugs, elimination might include avoiding unnecessary doses by carefully selecting appropriate therapy duration, discontinuing treatment when clinical benefit is no longer evident, or choosing non-pharmacologic alternatives when appropriate.

Substitution involves replacing a hazardous agent with a nonhazardous alternative or a lesser hazard. Examples include switching from intravenous administration to oral administration when therapeutically equivalent, selecting drugs with lower toxicity profiles when clinical efficacy is comparable, or using ready-to-administer formulations that eliminate compounding-related exposure.

Engineering controls isolate healthcare workers from the hazard through physical barriers or containment systems. The most important engineering control for hazardous drugs is compounding within a biological safety cabinet (BSC) or other containment primary engineering control (C-PEC). Additional engineering controls include closed-system drug transfer devices (CSTDs), needleless connectors, and negative-pressure isolation for rooms where hazardous drugs are prepared or administered.

Administrative controls change the way people interact with hazardous drugs through organizational policies, procedures, work practices, and training programs. Examples include restricting the number of personnel who handle hazardous drugs, establishing standard operating procedures for all hazardous drug processes, implementing medical surveillance programs, and conducting regular competency assessments.

Personal protective equipment (PPE) represents the least effective control measure in the hierarchy because it relies on correct and consistent use by individual workers and provides protection only to the person wearing it. However, PPE remains an essential component of hazardous drug safety programs when used in combination with higher-level controls. PPE creates a physical barrier between the healthcare worker and potential routes of exposure.

### **1.5 Personal Protective Equipment**

#### **1.5.1 Selection and Use**

Healthcare workers must wear appropriate personal protective equipment both to protect themselves from anticipated routes of exposure and to protect others from environmental contamination resulting from transmission of hazardous drugs on clothing or skin. PPE selection should be based on risk assessment considering the specific drugs being handled, the procedures being performed, and the potential routes of exposure.

All personal protective equipment must be removed immediately upon leaving the hazardous drug handling area to prevent contamination of clean areas and potential exposure of unprotected individuals. Contaminated PPE should be disposed of as hazardous waste following established protocols.\[^3\]\[^11\]\[^13\]\[^14\]

#### **1.5.2 Training and Competency**

Organizational policies and procedures must include detailed instructions for appropriate donning and doffing of personal protective equipment, including goggles, face shields, head covers, fit-tested respirators, chemotherapy gloves, and protective gowns. The sequence of donning and doffing is critical to prevent self-contamination, and healthcare workers commonly make errors during these procedures.\[^3\]\[^11\]\[^13\]\[^14\]

Organizations should assess and document competency in PPE donning and doffing for all employees who may experience environmental exposure to hazardous drugs. Competency assessment should include both initial demonstration of proper technique and ongoing monitoring of compliance with established procedures. Documentation of competency assessment provides evidence of organizational commitment to worker safety and may be required by regulatory agencies.\[^3\]\[^13\]

#### **1.5.3 Barriers to Compliance**

Research has identified numerous barriers that impede consistent use of appropriate personal protective equipment in hazardous drug handling. Organizations should actively work to improve PPE compliance by identifying and removing these barriers through environmental redesign, workflow modification, equipment selection, and cultural change initiatives.\[^3\]\[^7\]\[^11\]

Common barriers include inadequate availability of PPE at the point of use, uncomfortable or poorly fitting equipment, time pressure and workload demands, inadequate training in proper use techniques, lack of organizational safety culture, poor understanding of exposure risks, and absence of accountability for non-compliance. Addressing these barriers requires a multifaceted approach involving front-line workers, managers, safety professionals, and organizational leadership.

### **1.6 Special Populations**

#### **1.6.1 Reproductive Health Considerations**

Healthcare workers who are actively trying to conceive, currently pregnant, or breastfeeding should be allowed to refrain from exposure to hazardous drugs and contaminated waste. The evidence regarding reproductive risks from occupational hazardous drug exposure continues to evolve, and a precautionary approach protects both the healthcare worker and the developing fetus or nursing infant.

Guidelines from some countries suggest that avoidance of chemotherapy drug handling is necessary only for those trying to conceive and during the first trimester of pregnancy, reflecting different interpretations of the available evidence. However, many organizations adopt more conservative policies allowing avoidance throughout pregnancy and lactation. Organizations should develop clear policies addressing reproductive health concerns and provide work reassignment options that do not create career penalties for workers who choose to avoid hazardous drug exposure.\[^11\]\[^13\]\[^15\]

### **1.7 Environmental Monitoring**

#### **1.7.1 Surface Contamination Assessment**

Organizations should participate in environmental wipe sampling at least every six months to identify surface residue of hazardous drugs in areas where compounding, preparation, and administration are conducted. Environmental monitoring provides objective evidence of contamination and helps identify failures in work practices, engineering controls, or cleaning procedures.\[^3\]\[^7\]\[^11\]\[^15\]\[^16\]\[^17\]\[^18\]\[^19\]

Studies conducted in Canadian healthcare centers over a 10-year period demonstrated persistent surface contamination with antineoplastic drugs in both pharmacy and patient care areas, highlighting the need for ongoing vigilance and continuous improvement in contamination control.\[^17\]\[^19\] When surface contamination is detected, organizations must identify, document, and contain the source of contamination through thorough deactivation and decontamination procedures, along with adjustments in engineering or administrative controls to prevent recontamination.

Environmental wipe sampling should assess contamination on surfaces where hazardous drugs are prepared, stored, transported, and administered, as well as on equipment used in these processes. Sampling locations should include pharmacy compounding areas, patient treatment areas, medication storage locations, transport containers, infusion pumps, and work surfaces. Sampling should also assess the effectiveness of cleaning procedures and identify any persistent contamination that requires enhanced decontamination efforts.

### **1.8 Medical Surveillance**

Healthcare workers for whom hazardous drug handling is a regular part of their job assignment should participate in a medical surveillance program. Medical surveillance provides an opportunity for early detection of adverse health effects, counseling about reproductive risks, and reinforcement of safe work practices. The specific components of medical surveillance programs vary among organizations but typically include baseline health assessment, periodic health monitoring, reproductive health counseling, and exposure documentation.\[^3\]\[^5\]\[^7\]\[^11\]\[^20\]

Organizations should monitor individuals who have experienced acute hazardous drug exposure, such as significant spills or direct skin contact with concentrated drug solutions. Acute exposure monitoring may include clinical evaluation, laboratory testing if indicated, documentation of the exposure incident, and follow-up assessment to identify any delayed health effects.

### **1.9 Training and Competency Assessment**

#### **1.9.1 Initial Training Requirements**

Healthcare organizations must document that training and competency assessment for clinicians who handle hazardous drugs is completed prior to independent handling of these agents. Allowing untrained personnel to work with hazardous drugs creates unacceptable risks for the workers themselves and potentially for patients and colleagues.\[^3\]\[^7\]\[^11\]

Initial training programs should include comprehensive coverage of the institutional hazardous drug list and associated risks for each drug or drug category. Training must address all relevant policies and procedures, appropriate use of personal protective equipment and other equipment or devices, management of known or suspected exposure incidents, spill management procedures, and proper disposal of hazardous drugs and contaminated materials.

#### **1.9.2 Ongoing Competency Verification**

Organizations should reassess and document competency at least every 12 months for healthcare workers who handle hazardous drugs. Annual competency assessment ensures that workers maintain proficiency in safe handling techniques, stay current with policy updates, and receive reinforcement of critical safety principles. Some jurisdictions may require more frequent competency assessment or additional training when new hazardous drugs are introduced or when procedures change significantly.

### **1.10 Compounding and Preparation**

#### **1.10.1 Closed-System Drug Transfer Devices**

Where possible, organizations should use closed-system drug transfer devices during sterile compounding of hazardous drugs to further reduce the risk of exposure. CSTDs mechanically prohibit the transfer of environmental contaminants into the system and the escape of hazardous drug or vapor concentrations outside the system. While CSTDs provide an additional layer of protection, they do not eliminate the need for other control measures including biological safety cabinets and personal protective equipment.\[^3\]\[^4\]\[^5\]\[^7\]\[^13\]\[^15\]\[^19\]\[^20\]

When selecting closed-system drug transfer devices, organizations should prioritize devices with containment reduction demonstrated by independent, peer-reviewed studies rather than relying solely on manufacturer claims. The effectiveness of CSTDs varies considerably among products, and independent validation provides more reliable evidence of protective performance.

### **1.11 Administration Procedures**

#### **1.11.1 Protective Devices During Administration**

Healthcare workers should use protective devices such as needleless connectors and closed-system drug transfer devices for administration of all hazardous drugs when the dosage form allows. Selection of CSTDs for administration should be based on devices with proven containment reduction demonstrated by independent, peer-reviewed studies rather than marketing materials or theoretical claims.\[^3\]\[^7\]\[^11\]\[^13\]\[^21\]

#### **1.11.2 Priming and Connection Procedures**

Organizations should utilize the protection of the containment primary engineering control (C-PEC) to perform pre-administration activities including spiking the bag and priming the administration set. Performing these procedures within the biological safety cabinet or other C-PEC minimizes aerosolization and reduces exposure risk for healthcare workers.\[^3\]\[^6\]\[^11\]\[^15\]\[^21\]

Spiking the administration set and priming with a compatible fluid prior to addition of hazardous drug to the IV bag further reduces exposure risk. This technique ensures that any leaking that occurs when the administration set is first connected to the vascular access device involves fluid that does not contain the hazardous drug.

If spiking and priming must be performed outside the containment primary engineering control, healthcare workers should attach the unprimed set to the primary (non-hazardous) solution and back-prime to move air into the secondary (hazardous drug) container. This back-priming method should only be used with closed-system drug transfer devices that have proven capability to produce a dry connection without leakage.\[^3\]\[^6\]\[^11\]

#### **1.11.3 Connection Integrity and Disposal**

To prevent spills during hazardous drug infusion, healthcare workers should perform a visual inspection of the solution container, administration set, and vascular access device connections before starting the infusion. This inspection may identify loose connections, damaged components, or other issues that could lead to hazardous drug exposure.\[^22\]

After hazardous drug administration, healthcare workers should dispose of the drug container with the administration set still attached rather than disconnecting them. This practice eliminates exposure risk from aerosolization and spillage during disconnection but requires use of a new administration set for each hazardous drug dose.\[^6\]\[^11\]\[^15\]\[^21\]

### **1.12 Spill Management**

#### **1.12.1 Spill Kit Availability and Contents**

Organizations must prepare for and appropriately respond to hazardous drug spills to protect staff, visitors, and patients from exposure. Spill kits containing all necessary materials must be available wherever hazardous drugs are prepared, transported, or administered. The spill kit should include signage to restrict access to contaminated areas, preventing inadvertent exposure of individuals unaware of the spill.\[^3\]\[^11\]\[^23\]

Essential spill kit components include chemotherapy-resistant gloves, protective gowns, eye protection, shoe covers, absorbent materials, hazardous waste disposal bags, and appropriate deactivating agents. The specific contents may vary based on the types of hazardous drugs used in the area and the surfaces that might become contaminated.

#### **1.12.2 Spill Response Procedures**

Organizations should establish comprehensive spill response procedures through written protocols that specify appropriate deactivating agents, required dilutions if any, documentation and reporting requirements, responsible personnel, and proper use of spill kit materials according to the affected surface such as hard surfaces, carpet, or biological safety cabinets.\[^3\]\[^6\]\[^11\]

Appropriate spill response follows a systematic sequence: immediate containment to prevent spread of contamination, deactivation of the hazardous drug using appropriate chemical agents, decontamination of the affected surface, and thorough cleaning of the spill area. Each step serves a specific purpose in minimizing exposure and restoring safe environmental conditions.

Spills that exceed the capabilities of the standard spill kit should be handled by healthcare workers specifically trained in hazardous waste management, and a cartridge respirator or powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) must be used. Large spills may require external environmental health and safety specialists or hazardous materials teams with specialized training and equipment.

### **1.13 Exposure Management**

#### **1.13.1 Immediate Response Measures**

Healthcare workers must apply appropriate measures immediately following any exposure to hazardous drugs. The specific response depends on the route of exposure, but prompt action reduces the absorbed dose and may prevent or minimize adverse health effects.\[^6\]\[^11\]

Following skin exposure, the affected individual should immediately remove contaminated clothing and wash the skin thoroughly with soap and water. Prolonged washing for at least 15 minutes is recommended for significant exposures. For eye exposure, the affected eye should be flushed with saline or water for at least 15 minutes, followed by emergency medical treatment to assess for corneal injury or other damage.

If inhalation exposure occurs, the individual should immediately move away from the contaminated area to an area with fresh air and seek emergency treatment if symptoms are severe or persist. Respiratory symptoms following hazardous drug inhalation may indicate significant exposure requiring medical evaluation.

For skin puncture injuries such as needlestick injuries, the wound should be allowed to bleed freely for a brief period to help flush out any contaminating material, then thoroughly cleansed under running water using soap. Squeezing or aggressive manipulation of the wound is not recommended as this may increase tissue damage without significantly reducing exposure risk.

#### **1.13.2 Reporting and Follow-up**

All employee exposures to hazardous drugs must be reported to the organization's occupational health and safety department. Documentation of exposure incidents provides data for trend analysis, identifies areas requiring improvement in safety procedures, and establishes a record for medical surveillance purposes. Organizations should follow established policies for reporting patient or visitor exposures, which may involve different personnel and documentation systems than employee exposure reporting.

### **1.14 Waste Management**

#### **1.14.1 Segregation and Disposal Requirements**

Organizations must dispose of and segregate hazardous waste in accordance with jurisdictional regulations. Segregation of waste by type and source is necessary for safe disposal, although some jurisdictions do not require or permit detailed waste segregation. Healthcare facilities operating in multiple jurisdictions should comply with the most stringent applicable requirements.\[^6\]\[^24\]

Contaminated materials including empty vials, syringes, drug containers, administration sets, gloves, and gowns must be placed into sealable, leak-proof bags designated for hazardous waste. Needles, open ampoules, and other sharps require placement in puncture-proof hazardous waste containers to protect waste handlers from injury.\[^3\]\[^6\]\[^24\]\[^25\]

#### **1.14.2 Container Labeling and Separation**

Containers designated for hazardous waste must be clearly labeled to alert waste handlers to the contents and required precautions. Organizations should use color-coded waste containers to facilitate proper segregation and prevent inadvertent mixing of waste streams. Hazardous waste must never be placed in medical waste containers because medical waste and hazardous waste undergo different processing and disposal procedures.\[^6\]\[^24\]

Written procedures should specify the disposal process for unused hazardous drugs to ensure compliance with jurisdictional regulations. Bulk hazardous drug disposal regulations often differ from requirements for trace contaminated waste, and healthcare workers must understand these distinctions to ensure proper handling.

### **1.15 Patient Body Fluid Precautions**

Healthcare workers should employ safety precautions when handling patient body fluids and during patient care activities where contact with body fluids is anticipated or likely. These precautions should continue for at least 48 hours after receipt of a hazardous drug, and until the known excretion time is exceeded for drugs that remain in body fluids longer than 48 hours. Some hazardous drugs persist in urine, feces, blood, or other body fluids for extended periods, and pharmacy consultation can provide guidance regarding metabolism and excretion time for specific drugs.\[^6\]\[^13\]\[^26\]

Where possible, healthcare workers should use disposable linens and leakproof pads to contain contaminated body fluids, simplifying disposal and reducing environmental contamination. Washable linens that become contaminated with body fluids from patients receiving hazardous drugs should be placed in leakproof bags and handled as contaminated materials according to established procedures.

Patient education represents an important component of body fluid safety. Healthcare workers should educate patients and caregivers on safe handling of body fluids following hazardous drug administration, including proper disposal of disposable materials and appropriate laundry procedures for contaminated linens. Patients receiving hazardous drugs should be identified through posted signs, warnings, or labels to alert healthcare workers and visitors that special precautions are necessary when handling body fluids.

### **1.16 Home Healthcare Considerations**

#### **1.16.1 Spill Management in Home Settings**

Healthcare organizations providing home infusion therapy must provide spill kits whenever hazardous drugs are administered in the home setting. Home spill kits may use simplified cleaning procedures compared to institutional spill kits while maintaining adequate protection. Cleansing may be performed with standard dishwashing or laundry detergent using disposable cloths or paper towels, followed by cleansing with water using disposable towels.\[^3\]\[^6\]\[^13\]

#### **1.16.2 Waste Disposal and Laundry**

Patients and caregivers should store contaminated clothing or linens in plastic bags until ready to wash them. Contaminated linens and clothing should be placed in a washable pillowcase and machine washed twice, separate from other household laundry, using regular detergent. This double-wash procedure reduces residual drug contamination to safe levels.\[^6\]\[^13\]

Disposable diapers from patients receiving hazardous drugs should be discarded in plastic bags, and used gloves should be placed in hazardous waste containers if available. If hazardous waste containers are not provided, gloves and other contaminated disposable materials should be placed in plastic bags and disposed of according to local regulations. These materials should be stored in an area away from pregnant individuals, children, and pets to prevent inadvertent exposure.\[^13\]\[^24\]

# Medical Waste and Sharps Safety

### **2.1 Foundational Principles**

Safe handling and disposal of regulated medical waste protects healthcare workers, patients, waste handlers, and the broader community from exposure to potentially infectious materials. Waste management practices must be based on laws, rules, and regulations established in each jurisdiction, including countries, states, and provinces, and implemented through organizational policies, procedures, and practice guidelines.

Organizations should incorporate risk reduction for exposure to potentially infectious materials and needlestick injuries into comprehensive quality improvement programs. Systematic tracking and analysis of exposure incidents, waste handling practices, and sharps injuries enables identification of trends and implementation of targeted interventions to reduce risk.

### **2.2 Sharps Safety**

#### **2.2.1 Container Requirements and Placement**

Contaminated sharps must be discarded in containers that are closable, nonpermeable, puncture-resistant, tamperproof, and clearly labeled as biohazard containers. These containers must be easily accessible and located in the immediate area where sharps are used to encourage immediate disposal and prevent the hazardous practice of transporting used sharps.\[^8\]\[^11\]\[^12\]\[^13\]\[^15\]

Healthcare facilities should consider additional or enhanced security measures in areas where a higher risk of tampering exists, such as pediatric units, mental health units, and correctional facilities. Enhanced security may include locked sharps containers, video monitoring, or staff supervision of disposal areas.\[^15\]

#### **2.2.2 Sharps Container Sizing**

Organizations should provide sharps containers large enough to accommodate disposal of entire blood collection assemblies including the holder and needle without requiring disassembly. Attempting to separate components of blood collection devices increases needlestick injury risk and violates safe handling principles. Adequate container size eliminates this unnecessary manipulation and facilitates immediate disposal after use.\[^8\]\[^11\]\[^12\]\[^13\]\[^15\]

### **2.3 Needlestick Injury Prevention**

#### **2.3.1 Safety-Engineered Devices**

Healthcare workers should use safety-engineered devices to prevent needlestick injuries associated with parenteral medication preparation and administration, vascular access device insertion, and blood sampling procedures. Safety-engineered devices that isolate or remove the bloodborne pathogen hazard must be available in the workplace and used in accordance with manufacturer's directions.\[^1\]\[^2\]\[^3\]\[^4\]\[^5\]\[^6\]\[^7\]\[^8\]

Passive safety-engineered devices, which activate automatically without requiring a deliberate activation step by the healthcare worker, should be used whenever possible. Passive devices provide superior protection compared to active devices because they do not depend on healthcare worker compliance with activation procedures. Studies demonstrate that passive safety devices achieve higher activation rates and lower injury rates than active devices.\[^3\]\[^4\]\[^7\]\[^9\]\[^10\]

#### **2.3.2 Safe Handling Practices**

Healthcare workers must never recap, break, or bend sharps before disposal. Used sharps should be discarded directly into appropriate sharps containers immediately after use. Devices with built-in safety controls should have these features activated during use, and the entire device should be discarded as a single unit without disassembly.\[^11\]\[^12\]\[^13\]\[^14\]

The practice of recapping needles, even using a one-handed scoop technique, creates unnecessary exposure risk and should be prohibited except in rare circumstances where no safe alternative exists. Breaking or bending needles provides no safety benefit and significantly increases injury risk through unpredictable needle behavior and sharp fragment creation.

### **2.4 Education and Training**

#### **2.4.1 Comprehensive Safety Education**

Organizations should educate both clinicians and patients or caregivers in safe practices related to sharps handling, medical waste disposal, and use of safety-engineered devices. Research demonstrates that the risk of needlestick injury decreases when education is combined with implementation of sharps safety products, suggesting that knowledge and equipment availability work synergistically to improve safety.\[^2\]\[^7\]\[^16\]\[^17\]\[^18\]\[^19\]\[^20\]\[^21\]

Training programs should address the importance of reporting needlestick injuries and exposure to bloodborne pathogens. Needlestick injuries remain prevalent and significantly underreported in many countries, with reporting rates varying from less than 30% to over 70% depending on organizational culture, reporting systems, and perceived consequences of reporting.\[^2\]\[^7\]\[^16\]\[^17\]\[^18\]\[^19\]\[^20\]\[^21\]

#### **2.4.2 End-User Involvement**

Clinician end users should be involved in evaluation of safety-engineered devices before organizational purchasing decisions. End-user evaluation ensures that selected devices meet real-world clinical needs, function effectively in actual care environments, and achieve user acceptance necessary for consistent use. Healthcare workers who participate in device evaluation develop ownership of safety initiatives and provide valuable insights regarding device performance that may not be apparent in controlled testing environments.\[^3\]\[^11\]\[^12\]\[^14\]

Healthcare workers must receive education in proper use and activation of safety-engineered devices in accordance with manufacturer's directions. Even well-designed safety devices fail to prevent injuries if healthcare workers do not understand correct usage techniques or do not activate safety features consistently. Training should include hands-on practice with devices and competency assessment before independent clinical use.\[^3\]\[^5\]\[^6\]\[^22\]

### **2.5 Injury Reporting and Follow-up**

#### **2.5.1 Documentation Requirements**

Healthcare workers must identify, report, and document all exposures to potentially infectious materials or injuries from sharps according to established organizational protocols. Immediate reporting enables appropriate postexposure prophylaxis, establishes workers' compensation eligibility, provides data for safety analysis, and demonstrates organizational commitment to worker protection.\[^1\]\[^8\]\[^9\]\[^11\]\[^12\]\[^13\]\[^14\]\[^23\]\[^24\]\[^25\]\[^26\]\[^27\]

Organizations should monitor and analyze exposure data for trends and implement appropriate quality improvement activities based on identified patterns. Analysis may reveal specific devices, procedures, or work areas with elevated injury rates, enabling targeted interventions to reduce risk.

### **2.6 Medical Waste Management**

#### **2.6.1 Waste Segregation and Handling**

Healthcare organizations should sort and segregate medical waste according to federal, state, and local guidelines and regulations. Proper segregation ensures appropriate processing and disposal while potentially reducing costs associated with unnecessary classification of non-hazardous waste as regulated medical waste.\[^30\]\[^31\]\[^36\]\[^37\]

Research demonstrates that medical waste segregation combined with appropriate recycling and improved education and training may enhance medical waste disposal through improved knowledge and practice among waste handlers. Educational interventions addressing waste segregation have shown measurable improvements in waste handling compliance and reduction in improperly segregated waste.\[^30\]\[^31\]\[^36\]

#### **2.6.2 Waste Minimization Strategies**

Organizations should consider using standardized checklists as guidelines for handling medical waste to improve compliance with established procedures and reduce errors in waste classification and disposal.\[^28\] Checklists provide cognitive support for healthcare workers performing waste management tasks and ensure consistent application of waste handling principles.

Healthcare facilities should consider the environmental impact of medical waste and implement strategies to reduce unnecessary waste generation where clinically appropriate. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the substantial environmental burden of medical waste, with significant increases in plastic waste and associated environmental contamination.\[^29\]\[^30\]\[^31\]

Reducing potentially unnecessary sterile packaging represents one approach to waste minimization. Organizations may consider using Standard Aseptic Non Touch Technique (Standard-ANTT) instead of Surgical-ANTT using the ANTT Risk Assessment framework for procedures where the infection risk does not require full surgical asepsis. This approach maintains patient safety while reducing packaging waste and associated environmental impact.\[^32\]\[^33\]\[^34\]\[^35\]

### **2.7 Patient and Caregiver Education**

Healthcare organizations should provide comprehensive instruction to patients and caregivers who receive home infusion therapy regarding proper disposal of medical waste, including unused nonhazardous drugs or solutions and infusion-related supplies. Clear disposal instructions reduce the risk of injury to patients, family members, waste collection personnel, and the general public while ensuring compliance with local waste regulations.

Home care waste disposal education should address sharps container use, proper containment of contaminated materials, and appropriate disposal methods available in the community. Many communities offer sharps disposal programs through pharmacies, hospitals, or waste management services, and patients should be informed of available options.
