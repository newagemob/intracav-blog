# Vascular Access Device Complications

# Phlebitis in Vascular Access Management

## **Classification and Etiology**

Phlebitis is an inflammation of a vein that can occur during or after intravenous therapy. Understanding its etiology is essential for both prevention and appropriate intervention. Phlebitis is categorized into four primary types based on causative factors.

### **1.1 Chemical Phlebitis**

Chemical phlebitis results from endothelial inflammation or injury caused by the infusion of irritating substances. Contributing factors include:

**Irritating Infusates:** Certain medications and solutions are known to cause endothelial irritation. These include amiodarone, nicardipine, norepinephrine, levetiracetam, dextrose concentrations exceeding 10%, cancer chemotherapy agents, antibiotics (notably flucloxacillin and vancomycin), dobutamine, potassium chloride, and iron sucrose (Lv & Zhang, 2020; Simin et al., 2019; Van Boxtel et al., 2022).

**Infusate Characteristics:** Solutions with extreme pH levels or high osmolarity pose increased risk. Particulate matter within infusates may also contribute to vessel irritation (Van Boxtel et al., 2022).

**Infusion Parameters:** Inadequate hemodilution, excessive infusion rates through short peripheral catheters, and an increased number of infused medications all elevate risk (Simões et al., 2022; Yasuda et al., 2022).

**Procedural Factors:** Skin antiseptic solution that has not fully dried prior to catheter insertion can be drawn into the vein during the insertion process, causing chemical irritation (Helm et al., 2019).

### **1.2 Mechanical Phlebitis**

Mechanical phlebitis occurs when physical factors cause trauma or irritation to the vein's endothelial lining. Key contributing factors include:

**Catheter-to-Vein Ratio:** A catheter that is too large relative to the vessel diameter creates friction and pressure against the vessel wall (Piper et al., 2018; Mielke et al., 2022).

**Insertion Site and Technique:** Catheter placement in areas of flexion, improper insertion angle, and suboptimal tip positioning increase mechanical stress on the vessel. Insertion trauma itself can initiate the inflammatory response (Heng et al., 2020).

**Catheter Materials:** Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE/Teflon™) catheters and stiffer catheter materials have been associated with higher rates of mechanical phlebitis. Advances in catheter materials may reduce these complications (Moureau et al., 2022; Karaoğlan et al., 2022).

**Securement and Infusion Rate:** Inadequate catheter securement allows catheter movement within the vessel, while rapid infusion rates can contribute to vessel wall irritation (Liu et al., 2022).

### **1.3 Infectious Phlebitis**

Infectious phlebitis, also termed septic or suppurative thrombophlebitis, results from bacterial contamination through several pathways:

**Extraluminal Contamination:** This occurs when skin antisepsis is inadequate or when the catheter becomes contaminated during the insertion procedure (Helm et al., 2019).

**Intraluminal Contamination:** Bacteria may enter through the catheter hub during access or manipulation, or through contaminated fluids and medications (Koo et al., 2020).

**Hematogenous Seeding:** Infection originating elsewhere in the body can seed the catheter site through the bloodstream. This is more common in emergent insertions, when aseptic technique is compromised, or when dressings become contaminated (Helm et al., 2019).

### **1.4 Postinfusion Phlebitis**

Postinfusion phlebitis manifests 48 to 96 hours after catheter removal and may result from any of the factors described above. Research has identified PIVC insertion in the emergency department as a significant risk factor for this complication. Reported rates of postinfusion phlebitis vary considerably, ranging from 1% to 23% across studies (Webster et al., 2015; Urbanetto et al., 2016; Urbanetto et al., 2017).

## 

# Patient-Related Risk Factors

Certain patient characteristics elevate the risk of developing phlebitis. Clinicians should assess these factors when planning vascular access and during ongoing care.

**Immune and Infectious Status:** Current infection and immunodeficiency compromise the body's ability to maintain vessel integrity and fight contamination (Lv & Zhang, 2020).

**Mobility:** Reduced mobility limits blood flow and may increase catheter-related mechanical stress (Marsh et al., 2021).

**Thrombotic Risk:** A family history of deep vein thrombosis indicates potential for vessel-related complications (Simin et al., 2019).

**Comorbidities:** Various underlying health conditions may predispose patients to vascular complications.

**Insertion Location:** Catheter placement in the patient's dominant arm increases movement and mechanical stress. Lower extremity insertion in adults carries elevated risk and should be avoided except in infants (Fan et al., 2023).

**Demographic Factors:** Female gender and age 60 years or older have been associated with increased phlebitis risk in multiple studies (Lv & Zhang, 2020; Suliman et al., 2020).

**Pediatric Considerations:** Systematic review evidence suggests that overall phlebitis rates may be lower in pediatric patients compared to adults (Indarwati et al., 2020; Marsh et al., 2018).

# Prevention Strategies

Effective prevention requires a multifaceted approach addressing device selection, insertion technique, infusate management, and ongoing care.

### **3.1 Vascular Access Device Selection**

When infusates known to cause phlebitis are required, clinicians should consider the anticipated duration of therapy and total infusion time. For longer courses of irritating medications, a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) or other central vascular access device (CVAD) may be more appropriate than a peripheral catheter.

The choice of catheter size is critical: selecting the smallest gauge catheter appropriate for the intended therapy reduces catheter-to-vein ratio and associated mechanical irritation (Marsh et al., 2021; Karaoğlan et al., 2022). Insertion should target larger veins when possible, and areas of flexion should be avoided. For adult patients, lower limb insertion should be avoided; for neonates and non-mobilizing infants, this restriction does not apply (Zingg et al., 2023; Fan et al., 2023).

### **3.2 Insertion Technique and Skill**

Research demonstrates that PIVC insertion by infusion or vascular access specialist teams results in greater first-attempt insertion success and lower complication rates. Organizations should consider dedicated insertion teams and ensure that clinicians performing vascular access procedures maintain appropriate competencies (Zingg et al., 2023).

### **3.3 Skin Preparation**

Complete drying of antiseptic solution before catheter insertion is essential. Wet antiseptic can be drawn into the vein during insertion, causing chemical irritation. Clinicians must allow adequate time for the antiseptic to dry fully before proceeding.

### **3.4 Catheter Securement and Joint Stabilization**

Proper securement technology prevents catheter movement within the vessel, reducing mechanical irritation. When catheters must be placed near joints, appropriate stabilization techniques should be employed to minimize flexion-related complications (Ayat-Isfahani et al., 2017; Berger et al., 2022).

### **3.5 Infusate Management**

Collaboration with pharmacy can significantly reduce phlebitis risk. One study demonstrated that standardized drug administration measures supervised by a pharmacist—including attention to drug composition, administration rate, route selection, and compounding contraindications—were associated with reduced phlebitis rates in intensive care settings (Simões et al., 2022; Yasuda et al., 2022).

**Vancomycin Considerations:** Continuous vancomycin infusions should be administered via a CVAD rather than a peripheral or midline catheter. Research has documented thrombophlebitis in all patients receiving continuous vancomycin infusion via midline catheter, regardless of dilution, as confirmed by daily ultrasound assessment (Scarano et al., 2022).

**Dilution Strategies:** For medications associated with phlebitis, such as nicardipine, diluting the concentration may reduce incidence. One study demonstrated reduced nicardipine-related phlebitis in acute stroke patients through concentration dilution (Kawada et al., 2018).

**In-Line Filtration:** While infusate contaminants represent a potential cause of phlebitis, current evidence does not support routine use of in-line filters specifically for thrombophlebitis prevention. The patient populations most likely to benefit from filtration have not been clearly identified, and clinical study results remain uncertain. Further research is needed to establish beneficial effects, potential disadvantages, and cost-effectiveness (Van Boxtel et al., 2022).

### **3.6 Insertion and Maintenance Bundles**

Implementation of PIVC insertion and maintenance bundles has shown effectiveness in reducing complications including phlebitis. Bundle elements typically address site selection, insertion technique, securement, dressing management, and ongoing assessment (Ray-Barruel et al., 2019; Gunasundram et al., 2021; Singh et al., 2021; Steere et al., 2019; Diwakar et al., 2021).

### **3.7 Emergency Insertion Considerations**

Catheters inserted emergently under suboptimal aseptic conditions should be replaced when the patient is stabilized, within 48 hours of the original insertion. Adult patients with lower extremity catheters should have these relocated to an upper extremity site. For pediatric patients, catheters should be moved to a new proximal site or opposite side when feasible.

# Assessment and Monitoring

### **4.1 Clinical Assessment**

Regular assessment of vascular access sites is fundamental to early detection and intervention. Assessment frequency should be determined based on patient population, therapy type, and individual risk factors.

**Signs and Symptoms:** Clinicians should assess for swelling, erythema, leakage, palpable venous cord, purulent discharge, warmth, and pain or tenderness at the access site.

**Pain as an Early Indicator:** Pain at the insertion site may serve as an early warning sign of developing phlebitis. Clinicians should evaluate pain reports promptly and thoroughly (Simões et al., 2022; Mihala et al., 2018).

**Patient Education:** Patients should be instructed to report pain or tenderness at the vascular access site promptly, enabling early intervention.

### **4.2 Standardized Assessment Tools**

Organizations should adopt a standardized phlebitis scale or definition and apply it consistently. However, clinicians should recognize the limitations of existing assessment tools. Studies have documented low interrater reliability for commonly used signs, symptoms, and scales in phlebitis assessment. The type, number, and severity of signs and symptoms that define phlebitis vary among published studies. Further research is needed to develop valid and reliable assessment instruments (Göransson et al., 2017; Marsh et al., 2020; Ray-Barruel et al., 2020; Marsh et al., 2015).

### **4.3 Replacement Intervals**

Evidence supports clinically indicated replacement of PIVCs rather than routine scheduled replacement. Systematic review and meta-analysis have found no clear difference in thrombophlebitis rates between these approaches (Webster et al., 2019; Vendramim et al., 2020).

### **4.4 Comparative Device Outcomes**

Meta-analysis data indicate that phlebitis incidence does not differ significantly between midline catheters and PICCs, which may inform device selection decisions (Lu et al., 2022).

### **4.5 Postinfusion Monitoring**

Following PIVC removal, the site should be monitored for postinfusion phlebitis for 48 hours or until discharge. Patients and caregivers should receive written instructions describing signs and symptoms of phlebitis and guidance on whom to contact if symptoms develop (Webster et al., 2015; Urbanetto et al., 2016).

### **4.6 Emerging Assessment Technologies**

Technological advances may enhance future phlebitis detection capabilities:

**Ultrasound:** Serial ultrasonographic assessments show promise for early recognition of peripheral intravenous catheter failure and associated venous changes (Bahl et al., 2021; Goel et al., 2020).

**Infrared Thermography:** This technology may offer objective identification of early phlebitis development through detection of increased temperature differences at the access site. Studies suggest it may be a promising technique, though further validation is needed (Doesburg et al., 2019; Mielke et al., 2022).

## 

# Intervention and Management

### **5.1 Peripheral Intravenous Catheters**

Upon identification of signs or symptoms of phlebitis, the PIVC should be removed (Zingg et al., 2023; Marsh et al., 2015). The interprofessional team should collaborate to determine the need for continued vascular access and appropriate alternative access when indicated.

### **5.2 Midline Catheters and PICCs**

Transient mechanical phlebitis may occur after midline catheter or PICC insertion. Management of this self-limiting condition includes ensuring proper catheter securement, applying heat to the affected area, elevating the limb, and monitoring for 24 hours postinsertion. If signs and symptoms persist beyond this period, catheter removal should be considered.

### **5.3 Symptomatic Relief**

Several interventions may provide comfort and reduce phlebitis symptoms:

**Physical Measures:** Application of warm or cold compresses and limb elevation can provide symptomatic relief (Annisa et al., 2017; Gauttam & Vati, 2016).

**Pharmacologic Options:** Analgesics may be administered as needed, and anti-inflammatory agents may be considered (Goulart et al., 2020).

**Topical Treatments:** Various topical interventions have been studied for phlebitis prevention and treatment, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glycerine, aloe vera, and chamomile. However, systematic review has not established clear evidence of efficacy for these agents (Goulart et al., 2020; Garcia-Expósito et al., 2022; Charan & Chaurasia, 2018; Babaieasl et al., 2019).

### **5.4 Chemical Phlebitis Management**

When chemical phlebitis is suspected, clinicians should re-evaluate the need for ongoing vascular access and consider alternatives including different medications, slower infusion rates, greater infusate dilution, or transition to central vascular access (Kawada et al., 2018).

### **5.5 Infectious Phlebitis Management**

When infectious phlebitis is suspected or purulent drainage is present, the following actions are indicated:

1. Remove the catheter immediately  
2. Obtain cultures of purulent exudate and catheter tip  
3. Document site assessment findings thoroughly  
4. Monitor for signs of systemic infection  
5. Anticipate that surgical intervention may be required in severe cases

A retrospective pediatric study reported that antibiotic and anticoagulation therapy achieved resolution of septic thrombophlebitis in 57% of patients (Koo et al., 2020).

**Surveillance Considerations:** For healthcare facilities in the United States conducting central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) surveillance following National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) protocols, matching cultures from purulent drainage at a non-central line site are relevant for determining CLABSI attribution in public reporting metrics (CDC, 2023).

## **Documentation and Quality Improvement**

Accurate documentation of phlebitis incidents, interventions, and outcomes supports quality improvement efforts and enables organizations to identify patterns and implement targeted prevention strategies. Documentation should include assessment findings, suspected etiology, interventions performed, and patient response to treatment.

# Infiltration and Extravasation

## **Standards of Practice for Prevention, Recognition, and Management**

### **Definitions**

**Infiltration** refers to the inadvertent leakage of non-vesicant solution or medication from a vascular access device (VAD) into the surrounding tissue. **Extravasation** specifically describes the escape of vesicant agents—solutions or medications capable of causing tissue injury, necrosis, or blistering—into the perivascular space.

### **1.2 Core Standards**

Three fundamental standards govern clinical practice in this area. First, organizations must reduce infiltration and extravasation risk through careful selection of appropriate VADs and insertion sites, combined with validation of device position and patency before and during infusion therapy. Second, clinical staff must regularly assess both peripheral and central vascular access device sites for signs and symptoms of infiltration and extravasation before and during each infusion. Third, appropriate interventions must be implemented immediately upon recognition of infiltration or extravasation, with the intervention matched to the characteristics of the solution or medication escaping from the vein.

## 

# Prevention Through Optimal Device Selection

### **2.1 Vascular Access Device Selection and Site Planning**

Selecting the most appropriate VAD and insertion site represents the primary strategy for reducing infiltration and extravasation risk. Patients presenting with difficult venous access risk factors should be escalated to vascular access specialists or infusion teams as early as possible in their care trajectory (Ehmke, 2021; Massand et al., 2019; Marsh et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020; Gong et al., 2021).

Research consistently demonstrates significant educational needs among nursing staff regarding risk factors, optimal VAD selection, recognition of complications, and treatment strategies for infiltration and extravasation across all healthcare settings and patient populations (Ehmke, 2021; Gong et al., 2021; Melo et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2020; Indarwati et al., 2020; Sisan et al., 2018; Özalp Gerçeker et al., 2018). A controlled before-and-after study in a neonatal unit demonstrated that implementing clinical practice guidelines for peripheral intravenous catheter insertion and management significantly reduced extravasation events (Chan et al., 2020).

### **2.2 Understanding Vesicant, Irritant, and Non-Vesicant Classifications**

Clinical staff must recognize the critical differences between vesicant, non-vesicant, and irritant solutions and medications. Each organization should establish consensus on which medications are classified as vesicants and irritants based on their internal formularies and the specific patient populations they serve (Ehmke, 2021; Massand et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2020; Manrique-Rodríguez et al., 2021; David et al., 2020; Giménez Poderós et al., 2022; Ong & Van Gerpen, 2020; Vokurka et al., 2020).

The vesicant nature of certain antineoplastic and non-antineoplastic medications must be identified prior to administration. Clinical teams should be prepared to utilize recommended pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments in the event of extravasation, or to escalate care to clinicians capable of managing these injuries (Ehmke, 2021; Gong et al., 2021; Melo et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2020; Roditi et al., 2022; Karius & Colvin, 2021; Vokurka et al., 2020; Hackenberg et al., 2021; Milcheski et al., 2018; Kimmel et al., 2018).

Current literature reveals a paucity of data on extravasation incidence and treatment recommendations, with many guidelines based on animal studies and case reports. This area requires further study, and there are recommendations to establish extravasation registries to improve dissemination of outcomes data (Özalp Gerçeker et al., 2018; Hackenberg et al., 2021; Kimmel et al., 2018; Corbett et al., 2019; van der Pol et al., 2017; ACR Committee on Drugs and Contrast Media, 2023; Dufficy et al., 2022).

# Risk Factor Assessment

### **3.1 Framework for Risk Evaluation**

Comprehensive evaluation of risk factors associated with infiltration and extravasation enables clinicians to determine appropriate monitoring frequency and evaluate alternative vascular access options for patients at increased risk, including consideration of central vascular access devices (Ehmke, 2021; Gong et al., 2021; Melo et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2020; Indarwati et al., 2020; Karius & Colvin, 2021; Kleidon et al., 2019; Özalp Gerçeker et al., 2018).

### **3.2 Patient-Specific Risk Factors**

Multiple studies have identified patient-specific factors associated with increased risk of infiltration and extravasation (Ehmke, 2021; Kim et al., 2020; Gong et al., 2021; Roditi et al., 2022; Kleidon et al., 2019; Boyar & Galiczewski, 2021; Vokurka et al., 2020; Milcheski et al., 2018; Oncology Nursing Society, 2023; Boyar & Galiczewski, 2018; Loubani & Green, 2015; Wasserman et al., 2019; Chong et al., 2021; Hwang et al., 2018):

**Sex and infection status** play a role, with female patients and those with current infections demonstrating increased susceptibility. **Sensory and communication factors** create additional risk; patients with altered sensation near the VAD site due to neuropathy or application of pre-insertion pain relief products may not detect early warning signs, as may those who have difficulty communicating the onset of pain, tightness, or other discomfort.

**Cognitive factors** compound these risks. Patients with altered mental status or cognition—whether from encephalopathy, confusion, or sedating medications—cannot reliably report symptoms. **Underlying disease processes** that produce changes in vasculature or impaired circulation significantly increase vulnerability. These include malignancy, diabetes mellitus, lymphedema, systemic lupus erythematosus, Raynaud's disease, peripheral neuropathy, and peripheral vascular disease. **Venous access history** matters as well; patients with difficulty establishing peripheral venous access related to history of multiple venipunctures or obesity present elevated risk.

**Age-related factors** deserve particular attention at both ends of the lifespan. Neonates and young children face increased risk due to their inability to communicate discomfort, fragile vasculature and skin, limited physiologic resources to repair cellular damage, and a lack of safe and effective VAD securement and dressing options appropriately sized for their anatomy (Gong et al., 2021; Indarwati et al., 2020; Karaoğlan et al., 2022; Kleidon et al., 2019; Özalp Gerçeker et al., 2018; Boyar & Galiczewski, 2021; Hackenberg et al., 2021; Dufficy et al., 2022; Fonzo-Christe et al., 2018). Elderly patients experience anatomical changes including loss of thickness of the dermal skin layer, thickening of the tunica intima and media, and loss of connective tissue that contribute to vein fragility and create challenges in vascular access.

### **3.3 Mechanical Risk Factors**

Mechanical causes of infiltration and extravasation require assessment and preventive action. Reduction or loss of patency of the VAD or vessel may result from abnormalities such as fibrin sleeve formation, venous thrombosis, pinch-off syndrome, and catheter fracture (Ehmke, 2021; Melo et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2020; Taibi et al., 2020).

Patient movement and positioning affect VAD performance in multiple ways. Normal body movements, unpredictable patient activity (particularly in infants, children, and confused patients), events that increase tension on or malposition of the VAD (such as patient repositioning or transport), and procedures requiring specific positions (such as a "tucked arm" during surgery) all contribute to risk (Kleidon et al., 2019; Pysyk et al., 2019; Sampson, 2019).

Events that increase the risk of vessel trauma include rapid infusions and use of bolus features on infusion pumps (Marsh et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020; Melo et al., 2020; ACR Committee on Drugs and Contrast Media, 2023; Abe-Doi et al., 2019). Insertion of the VAD in an area of flexion creates additional vulnerability (Gong et al., 2021). Notably, infiltration and extravasation rates are significantly higher in peripheral intravenous catheters inserted in the emergency department compared to other units, likely due to high-volume infusions, frequent insertion at the antecubital fossa, use of large-bore catheters, and blood sampling through the device (Marsh et al., 2020).

Multiple insertion attempts, especially in the same anatomic location, increase infiltration risk (Ehmke, 2021; Kim et al., 2020; Kleidon et al., 2019; Braga et al., 2018; Liew et al., 2021; Larsen et al., 2021). Catheter malposition occurring during the lifespan of the VAD presents ongoing concerns.

### **3.4 Reducing VAD Malposition Risk**

Clinicians should take specific steps to reduce VAD malposition during insertion and throughout post-insertion care. For intraosseous devices, adequate needle length for the patient must be ensured per manufacturers' recommendations (Wasserman et al., 2019; Sampson, 2019). For peripheral intravenous catheters, adequate vein purchase—meaning sufficient length of the catheter residing within the vessel—should be confirmed (Tran et al., 2020; Fonzo-Christe et al., 2018; Favot et al., 2019).

**Central vascular access devices** require particular vigilance. Extravascular CVAD tip malposition, dislodgement, or fracture can occur in many anatomical locations and at any point during dwell time. Clinicians should measure vessel depth in tissue using ultrasound prior to CVAD insertion to ensure all lumen exit sites are within the patient's vasculature, since partial dislodgement can result in more proximal lumen exit sites infusing into subcutaneous tissue (Govil et al., 2019; Spencer, 2019).

Daily catheter position monitoring should be performed in inpatient settings, comparing measurements to those documented at insertion. In outpatient settings, regular monitoring should occur at appropriate intervals. All catheter lumens should be checked for blood return and flushed prior to use. Clinicians should not assume appropriate intravascular tip position of all lumens when blood aspirate is possible from one lumen but not all (Govil et al., 2019; Spencer, 2019).

In addition to mechanical risk factors, CVADs may gradually become malpositioned due to growth of the infant or child with a long-term device in place (Yu et al., 2020). Clinicians should monitor for sudden changes in clinical condition in patients of all ages that may indicate extravascular administration of medication involving a centrally administered vesicant. Warning signs include new onset hypoxia, respiratory distress, hypotension, abdominal distension or pain, edema, and airway impingement (Chan et al., 2020; Vokurka et al., 2020; Hackenberg et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2020; Cahill et al., 2021; Hong et al., 2022; Edison et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2020).

When evaluating new pleural effusion, abscess, or lesion in an area related to the CVAD, clinical criteria including radiologic imaging, laboratory values, and aspiration of fluid should be used to determine the presence of infiltration or extravasation versus other clinical complications. Administration of a vesicant (such as hypertonic parenteral nutrition in fragile vessels) and the mechanical forces of the catheter may cause vessel erosion, allowing the vesicant to invade surrounding structures including the liver, mediastinum, abdomen, and thoracic cavity (Spencer, 2019; Cahill et al., 2021; Hong et al., 2022).

**Neonates face particularly high risk** for extravasation with CVAD insertion, whether umbilical, peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC), or femoral catheter. Complications resulting in morbidity and mortality include ascites, abdominal compartment syndrome, hepatic laceration, hepatic necrosis, hepatic abscess, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and hemi-diaphragmatic paralysis (Yu et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Baldo et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2021; Hargitai et al., 2019; Gupta et al., 2018; Ng et al., 2021; Rajendran & Sinha, 2021; Kotinatot et al., 2019; Kamupira et al., 2022; Yew et al., 2022).

Radiographic tests should be anticipated to validate CVAD tip location. Timing of CVAD removal depends on the plan of care based on identified extravascular location of the catheter tip. Assessment of the location of a subcutaneous tunnel or port pocket and its proximity to any wound helps determine if the long-term CVAD should be removed for healing to occur. Consultation with a wound care specialist should be considered.

### **3.5 Peripheral Intravenous Catheter-Specific Risk Factors**

Several factors specific to peripheral intravenous catheters may increase infiltration and extravasation risk (Massand et al., 2019; Marsh et al., 2020; Melo et al., 2020; Roditi et al., 2022; Seo et al., 2020; Boyar & Galiczewski, 2021; Vokurka et al., 2020; Oncology Nursing Society, 2023; Milcheski et al., 2018; Corbett et al., 2019; Hwang et al., 2018; Fonzo-Christe et al., 2018; Braga et al., 2018):

PIVC sites in the hand, wrist, foot, ankle, antecubital fossa, and areas with minimal subcutaneous tissue coverage present elevated risk. When insertion in an area of flexion is deemed necessary, more frequent monitoring is required, joint stabilization may be needed, and consideration should be given to early removal and reinsertion in a location with reduced risk of complication.

Additional PIVC-specific risk factors include use of steel "butterfly" needles, inadequate catheter securement, short PIVCs with dwell time longer than 24 hours, and increased manipulation of the PIVC at the catheter hub. Inability to establish patency through positive blood return or site assessment during flushing (such as when diffuse edema is present), delivery of a vesicant in an insertion site below a recent venipuncture (less than 24 hours prior), and depth of the PIVC (which may delay visual signs and symptoms of failure when the tip lies in a deep vein, particularly in non-verbal patients) all contribute to risk. PIVC administration of contrast media also increases vulnerability.

### **3.6 Pharmacologic and Physiochemical Risk Factors**

The pharmacologic or physiochemical properties of infusates significantly influence infiltration and extravasation risk and severity of tissue damage. Contributing factors include length of infusion of vesicant via a PIVC, drug concentration, volume escaping into the tissue, ability of surrounding tissues to absorb the drug, hyperosmolarity, non-physiological pH, the medication's ability to bind DNA, the medication's capacity to kill replicating cells or cause vascular constriction, and excipients such as alcohol or polyethylene glycol used in drug formulation (Ehmke, 2021; Gong et al., 2021; David et al., 2020; Melo et al., 2020; Roditi et al., 2022; Seo et al., 2020; Loubani & Green, 2015; Vokurka et al., 2020; Yew et al., 2022; Caballero Romero et al., 2018).

## 

# Early Recognition and Detection

### **4.1 Assessment Frequency and Visual Inspection**

Limiting the extent of infiltration and extravasation injury requires both preventive measures and early recognition of signs and symptoms through regular visual inspection and bilateral palpation of limbs. VAD insertion sites should be assessed at a frequency based upon the specific patient population and characteristics of the infusion therapy (Ehmke, 2021; David et al., 2020; Melo et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2020; Roditi et al., 2022; Milcheski et al., 2018; Gil et al., 2017; Yew et al., 2022; Ray-Barruel et al., 2019; Richardson et al., 2021).

Establishing monitoring standards for VADs utilized in intraoperative and intraprocedural areas represents an area requiring further research, given inherent barriers to visualization including sterile drapes, tucked limbs, competing priorities, and rapid infusions (Fonzo-Christe et al., 2018; Mecoli et al., 2022; Park & Kim, 2020; Hoefnagel et al., 2021; Ang et al., 2022).

### **4.2 Recognizing Critical Complications**

Acute abnormalities in pain, sensation, or circulation should be promptly recognized and reported. Compartment syndrome and arterial and nerve damage may result from infiltration or extravasation of sufficient infusate volume to cause tissue ischemia or injury. Significant long-term complications may include complex regional pain syndrome, neurovascular compromise, or limb amputation (Roditi et al., 2022; Milcheski et al., 2018; Corbett et al., 2019; ACR Committee on Drugs and Contrast Media, 2023; Wasserman et al., 2019; Park & Kim, 2020; Hoefnagel et al., 2021; Ang et al., 2022; Papatheodorou et al., 2022; Raveendran et al., 2019).

High risk for these complications exists with VAD insertion in small vessels, areas of flexion, or areas with tight subfascial compartments such as the hand, wrist, and forearm. If compartment syndrome is suspected, the affected extremity should be elevated to the level of the heart to optimize perfusion, and the surgeon or plastic surgeon should be notified immediately when circulatory or neurological compromise is suspected.

### **4.3 Signs and Symptoms**

Observation of the VAD site and areas proximal and distal to the insertion site should assess for several abnormalities (Ehmke, 2021; Kim et al., 2020; Ong & Van Gerpen, 2020; Hackenberg et al., 2021; Wasserman et al., 2019; El-Zaatari et al., 2019):

**Fluid leakage** from the puncture site, subcutaneous tunnel, or port pocket may be visible or subcutaneous. **Skin injury**, including vesicle formation, may appear within hours (as with contrast media) or may be delayed for days (as with antineoplastic agents). Progression to ulceration may vary from a few days to one to two weeks, depending on the vesicant administered. **Discoloration or hyperpigmentation** may also be observed.

Other conditions with similar symptoms must be ruled out, including phlebitis, flare reactions, and rash (Kim et al., 2020; Ahn & Park, 2021). A notable case report illustrates subdural infiltration from a scalp PIVC in a neonate used to deliver fluid and blood products. The changes in neurovascular status were initially thought to represent intracranial hemorrhage but were found to result from significant intracranial infiltration (Fleiss et al., 2021).

### **4.4 Extremity Assessment**

Assessment of the extremity and areas proximal and distal to the insertion site, with comparison to the contralateral limb, should include the following elements (Kim et al., 2020; David et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2020; Hackenberg et al., 2021; Govil et al., 2019):

Palpation of the insertion site assesses for swelling and pain. Swelling or edema may appear as a raised area under the skin near the peripheral VAD site or as an enlarged and tense extremity due to fluid accumulating in compartments of the extremity. Edema from a CVAD may appear as a raised area on the neck, chest, or groin. Circumference of both extremities should be compared if unilateral edema is noted, with comparison to baseline measurement at insertion when available. Changes in color may include redness or blanching; however, infiltration or extravasation into deep tissue may not produce visible color changes.

The patient's report of pain should be elicited, with observation of non-verbal patients for other cues indicating pain. Pain may be the initial symptom and may be sudden and severe when associated with rapid injection of solution or medications. Pain may be out of proportion to the injury or may appear with passive stretching of the muscles in the extremity. Pain intensity may increase over time, which may indicate compartment syndrome (Kim et al., 2020; Gong et al., 2021; Melo et al., 2020; Santos et al., 2021; Hackenberg et al., 2021; ACR Committee on Drugs and Contrast Media, 2023).

### **4.5 Detection Technology**

Infiltration and extravasation detection technology may aid in early recognition, though further research is needed to determine optimal use. Options under investigation include thermosensitive crystal film, near infrared camera, radiofrequency detection, gamma scintillation, color flow doppler, impulse oscillometry, and point-of-care ultrasound (van Rens et al., 2022; Roditi et al., 2022; Abe-Doi et al., 2019; Gautam et al., 2017; Frunza et al., 2022; Abe-Doi et al., 2020; Hinricher et al., 2021; Hirata et al., 2023; Abe-Doi et al., 2020).

Careful assessment in conjunction with detection technology remains essential, as devices may fail to detect abnormalities or fail to adequately warn clinicians, especially in settings where the VAD is not readily accessible (van Rens et al., 2022; Frunza et al., 2022). **Critically, clinicians should not rely on alarms from electronic infusion pumps to identify infiltration and extravasation**; alarms are not designed to detect the presence or absence of complications. Electronic infusion pumps do not cause infiltration or extravasation; however, they may mask or exacerbate the problem until the infusion is stopped (van Rens et al., 2022; Pysyk et al., 2019).

### **4.6 Contrast Media Administration**

When contrast administration is planned, a VAD designed for contrast administration should be inserted in an optimal location to ensure adequate monitoring during the procedure. Proper function should be assessed prior to, during, and following contrast media infusion, and delivery of contrast should be adjusted to conform to the chosen VAD (Roditi et al., 2022; ACR Committee on Drugs and Contrast Media, 2023; Hwang et al., 2018; Stowell et al., 2020).

Extravasation can occur with both manual and automated delivery of contrast. Automated power or pressure injectors produce a jet of fluid exiting the catheter tip. Distal tip malposition has been documented following power injection in PICCs, and it has been postulated that this jet could induce vessel perforation and extravasation (Roditi et al., 2022; ACR Committee on Drugs and Contrast Media, 2023; Raveendran et al., 2019; Papatheodorou et al., 2022).

Fluid warming may be associated with lower rates of extravasation. Fluid with high viscosity, such as contrast media, requires less force to administer when warmed to 37°C (Roditi et al., 2022; ACR Committee on Drugs and Contrast Media, 2023; Hwang et al., 2018; Basharat et al., 2022). Use of extravasation detection accessories, such as equivalent dose rate monitoring, should be considered to provide early detection, automated interruption of power injection, and guidance for contrast extravasation management (Roditi et al., 2022; Mazzara et al., 2022; Tylski et al., 2021).

## 

# Immediate Response to Infiltration and Extravasation

### **5.1 Initial Actions**

Upon identification of an infiltration or extravasation injury, the infusion must be stopped immediately and appropriate interventions initiated (Ehmke, 2021; Kim et al., 2020; Melo et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2020; Roditi et al., 2022; Ong & Van Gerpen, 2020; Vokurka et al., 2020; Stowell et al., 2020).

**Do not flush the VAD**, as this will inject additional medication into the tissue. The administration set should be disconnected from the catheter hub, and aspiration from the catheter or implanted port access needle attempted with a small syringe, even though a very small amount of fluid may be retrieved. The role of aspiration is not clear with extravasation of contrast media (Ehmke, 2021; Kim et al., 2020; Melo et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2020; Roditi et al., 2022; Ong & Van Gerpen, 2020; Vokurka et al., 2020; Hackenberg et al., 2021; Kimmel et al., 2018; Corbett et al., 2019; ACR Committee on Drugs and Contrast Media, 2023; Gil et al., 2017).

The peripheral catheter or implanted vascular access port access needle should be removed (Ehmke, 2021; Kim et al., 2020; Vokurka et al., 2020; Kimmel et al., 2018; Canadian Vascular Access Association, 2019; Lv et al., 2021). Application of pressure to the area should be avoided (Kim et al., 2020; Vokurka et al., 2020; Santos et al., 2021). The extremity should be elevated to encourage lymphatic reabsorption of the solution or medication, unless compartment syndrome is suspected (Massand et al., 2019; Melo et al., 2020; Roditi et al., 2022; Ong & Van Gerpen, 2020; Corbett et al., 2019; ACR Committee on Drugs and Contrast Media, 2023; Gil et al., 2017). The affected extremity should be avoided for subsequent VAD insertion until resolved (Canadian Vascular Access Association, 2019).

### **5.2 Site Assessment Following Identification**

Thorough assessment of the insertion site and surrounding tissue should include assessment of the area distal to the VAD site for capillary refill, sensation, and motor function (Ong & Van Gerpen, 2020; Santos et al., 2021; ACR Committee on Drugs and Contrast Media, 2023; Wasserman et al., 2019). Using a skin marker, the area suspected of infiltration or extravasation should be outlined to assess progression (Melo et al., 2020; Roditi et al., 2022). The area should be photographed to identify progression or exacerbation of the tissue injury in accordance with organizational policy (Ehmke, 2021; Melo et al., 2020; Karius & Colvin, 2021).

The volume of solution that has escaped into the tissue should be estimated based on the original amount of solution in the container, the amount remaining when stopped, and rate and duration of injection or infusion (Vokurka et al., 2020; Gil et al., 2017; Raveendran et al., 2019). Estimated extravasated volumes of contrast media less than 50 mL are more likely to resolve with conservative treatment, while volumes greater than 50 mL are at higher risk to cause tissue damage requiring treatment. However, the patient's symptoms should dictate treatment options over the estimated extravasated volume. Radiologic imaging to evaluate a contrast extravasation is rarely indicated (Roditi et al., 2022; ACR Committee on Drugs and Contrast Media, 2023; Hwang et al., 2018; Raveendran et al., 2019).

### **5.3 Provider Notification and Treatment Protocol Activation**

The provider should be notified about the event and the established treatment protocol or prescribed treatment activated (Ehmke, 2021; Kim et al., 2020; Melo et al., 2020; Roditi et al., 2022; Vokurka et al., 2020; Milcheski et al., 2018; ACR Committee on Drugs and Contrast Media, 2023; Gil et al., 2017).

The need for surgical consultation is based on organizational policy, clinical signs and symptoms and their progression, volume of injury, and the tissue-destroying nature of a vesicant medication. Treatment options that may be considered include subcutaneous irrigation with or without hyaluronidase, open incision and irrigation, small incisions followed by massage to force drainage, and debridement with skin graft or flap as indicated. The paucity of evidence supporting one surgical intervention over another means consideration should be given to the risks and benefits of conservative versus invasive treatment (Massand et al., 2019; Hackenberg et al., 2021; Milcheski et al., 2018; Little et al., 2020).

## 

# Treatment Protocols

### **6.1 General Treatment Principles**

Treatment should be initiated promptly as appropriate for the type and volume of solution or medication in the tissue surrounding the VAD, with the goal of limiting damage from medication or solution exposure. Organizations should provide convenient access to the list of vesicants and irritants, infiltration and extravasation management protocols, electronic order forms, supplies, and other materials needed to manage the event (Massand et al., 2019; Chan et al., 2020; Ong & Van Gerpen, 2020; Santos et al., 2021; Corbett et al., 2019; Gil et al., 2017).

**Wet compresses should be avoided**, as they may cause maceration (Vokurka et al., 2020; Santos et al., 2021).

### **6.2 Heat and Cold Application**

High-quality evidence to recommend use of heat or cold application in the treatment of extravasation injury is lacking (Ong & Van Gerpen, 2020; Hackenberg et al., 2021; ACR Committee on Drugs and Contrast Media, 2023). The rationale for cold application is to decrease absorption, keep the infusate localized, and decrease inflammation, while heat is used to encourage vasodilation and improve blood flow to disperse the medication through the tissue (Ehmke, 2021; Kim et al., 2020; Santos et al., 2021).

Use of cold and heat applications are recommended in contrast extravasation, with a general preference for cold due to the potential to reduce inflammation (Roditi et al., 2022; ACR Committee on Drugs and Contrast Media, 2023). A scoping review on treatment of extravasation in infants and children found that cold and heat application is rarely used in this population (Corbett et al., 2018).

**Dry, cold compresses** should be applied for DNA-binding agents and valproate because the goal is to cause vasoconstriction to localize the medication in the tissue and reduce inflammation (Ehmke, 2021; Kim et al., 2020; Melo et al., 2020; Vokurka et al., 2020; Gil et al., 2017). Cold compresses should not be used with extravasation in the presence of agents that may cause vasoconstriction or in the presence of vaso-occlusive events such as sickle cell anemia (Ong & Van Gerpen, 2020; Santos et al., 2021). If dexrazoxane is indicated, the cold compress should be removed 15 minutes before the infusion of dexrazoxane begins (Ehmke, 2021; Melo et al., 2020; Vokurka et al., 2020; Kimmel et al., 2018).

**Dry, warm compresses** should be applied for non-DNA binding agents to encourage vasodilation (Ehmke, 2021; Kim et al., 2020; Gil et al., 2017).

### **6.3 Antidotes**

#### **Dexrazoxane**

Daily intravenous infusion of dexrazoxane over 3 days is the recommended antidote for anthracycline extravasation, including liposomal and pegylated anthracycline formulations (Ehmke, 2021; Melo et al., 2020). The infusion should begin within 6 hours of the extravasation and be infused into the opposite extremity (Ehmke, 2021; Melo et al., 2020; Vokurka et al., 2020). Topical dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) should not be applied to patients receiving dexrazoxane, as it may diminish dexrazoxane efficacy (Melo et al., 2020; Vokurka et al., 2020).

#### **Hyaluronidase**

Hyaluronidase is not considered an antidote to a specific vesicant but rather an enzyme that increases absorption and dispersion of the medication or solution in the tissue. Its use is reported with cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic agents, including both acidic and alkalotic drugs (such as amiodarone and phenytoin), vinca alkaloids, as well as hyperosmolar solutions (such as parenteral nutrition) and calcium salts. Recombinant hyaluronidase is not derived from animals and may have a lower risk of allergic response. Subcutaneous injection within 1 hour of the extravasation event produces the best response. Use of dry heat in conjunction with hyaluronidase works synergistically to increase blood flow and disperse the extravasated drug. Hyaluronidase is not considered first-line treatment for contrast extravasation (Ehmke, 2021; Melo et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2020; Roditi et al., 2022; Ong & Van Gerpen, 2020; Vokurka et al., 2020; ACR Committee on Drugs and Contrast Media, 2023; Oncology Nursing Society, 2023; Corbett et al., 2018).

Subcutaneous saline irrigation or saline irrigation with prior hyaluronidase administration for vesicant removal and dispersion in neonates should be considered. Further study is needed in the use of this practice, as resolution with conservative treatment is common (van Rens et al., 2022; Yew et al., 2022; Corbett et al., 2018).

#### **Sodium Thiosulfate**

Sodium thiosulfate is recommended for mechlorethamine extravasation and has been suggested for bendamustine, calcium, and large extravasations of cisplatin (Ehmke, 2021; David et al., 2020; Melo et al., 2020; Corbett et al., 2018; Pacheco Compaña et al., 2018).

#### **Phentolamine and Alternative Vasodilators**

Phentolamine is preferred for vasopressor extravasation. Normal perfusion of the area may be seen within 10 minutes of administration. Repeated injection may be necessary if hypoperfusion is still present or if vasoconstriction is extending to a greater area (Ong & Van Gerpen, 2020; Santos et al., 2021; Gil et al., 2017).

Terbutaline injection has been used for vasopressor extravasation when phentolamine is not immediately available (David et al., 2020; Ong & Van Gerpen, 2020). Topical nitroglycerin 2% may be applied as a 1-inch strip to the site of vasopressor extravasation in the absence of phentolamine, repeated every 8 hours as clinically indicated (David et al., 2020; Ong & Van Gerpen, 2020; Shrestha et al., 2020).

#### **Corticosteroids**

Use of oral, topical, or intralesional steroid should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Single-center studies and case reports have reported reduced inflammation and swelling; however, evidence of benefit is inconsistent and may not be recommended (David et al., 2020; Melo et al., 2020; Roditi et al., 2022; Vokurka et al., 2020).

### **6.4 Irrigation and Washout Procedures**

Irrigation or washout may assist in removal of specific infusates from surrounding tissue, including acidic agents, alkalotic agents, contrast media, specific cytotoxic agents, and parenteral nutrition (Melo et al., 2020; Roditi et al., 2022; Hackenberg et al., 2021; Corbett et al., 2019; Gil et al., 2017; Taibi et al., 2020; Van Look et al., 2022).

Other treatments reported in the treatment of severe tissue injury due to extravasation include negative pressure wound therapy, needle aspiration, emergency evacuation with low-pressure suction, ethacridine lactate dressing with phototherapy, acellular fish skin graft dressing, and dehydrated human amniotic membrane allograft (Massand et al., 2019; Milcheski et al., 2018; Boyar & Galiczewski, 2018; Ahn & Park, 2021; Van Look et al., 2022; Girard et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2021; Faraji et al., 2022).

**Injection of an acidic or alkaline medication to neutralize the pH of an extravasated acidic or alkaline vesicant should be avoided**, as the resulting chemical reaction could cause gas formation and exacerbate the tissue injury (David et al., 2020; Stefanos et al., 2023).

While skin discoloration from iron infiltration may be permanent, laser treatment has been reported to be successful in reducing staining (Eggenschwiler et al., 2020).

# Documentation and Standardized Assessment

### **7.1 Standardized Assessment Tools**

A standardized age- or population-specific tool or definition should be used to consistently evaluate infiltration and extravasation events from all types of VADs. The chosen tool should be valid, reliable, and clinically feasible. The selected scale should be accompanied by appropriate interventions to manage each level of injury on the scale. Several scales have been published; however, further research is needed to establish validity and interrater reliability for specific populations (Kim et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2020; Roditi et al., 2022; Özalp Gerçeker et al., 2018; Ong & Van Gerpen, 2020; Santos et al., 2021; Corbett et al., 2019; Dufficy et al., 2022; Yew et al., 2022).

An infant infiltration scale was recently revised and found to be valid and reliable for this population in an observational, prospective study (Incekar et al., 2019).

### **7.2 Documentation Requirements**

A standardized format should be used to document initial and ongoing assessment and monitoring of the infiltration or extravasation site and all factors involved with the event (Melo et al., 2020; van Rens et al., 2022; Ong & Van Gerpen, 2020; Santos et al., 2021; Kimmel et al., 2018; ACR Committee on Drugs and Contrast Media, 2023; Gil et al., 2017; Fonzo-Christe et al., 2018).

Accuracy of PIVC complication rates (including phlebitis, extravasation, and occlusion) is reduced by clinical knowledge deficits in symptom recognition, gaps in documentation, and a lack of consistent PIVC outcome definitions used in the literature (Ehmke, 2021; Marsh et al., 2020; Gong et al., 2021; Indarwati et al., 2020; Sisan et al., 2018; Özalp Gerçeker et al., 2018; Atay et al., 2021).

---

## 

# Ongoing Monitoring and Follow-Up

Site monitoring should continue as needed based on severity of the event and the venue of care, as signs and symptoms of infiltration and extravasation may be delayed in presentation. Changes in the area should be assessed by measurement and photography, with observation of skin integrity, level of pain, sensation, and motor function of the extremity (David et al., 2020; Melo et al., 2020; Karius & Colvin, 2021; Özalp Gerçeker et al., 2018; Gil et al., 2017; Fonzo-Christe et al., 2018; Ahn & Park, 2021).

Inflammation following contrast media extravasation generally peaks at 24-48 hours from the event (ACR Committee on Drugs and Contrast Media, 2023). Conducting follow-up phone calls or a follow-up visit to evaluate progression of an extravasation in the outpatient setting should be considered (Roditi et al., 2022; Karius & Colvin, 2021; Santos et al., 2021; ACR Committee on Drugs and Contrast Media, 2023).

---

## 

# Patient and Caregiver Education

The patient and caregivers should be educated regarding extravasation risk to improve prompt recognition of symptoms (Ehmke, 2021; Kim et al., 2020; David et al., 2020; Melo et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2020; Roditi et al., 2022; Vokurka et al., 2020; Braga et al., 2018; ACR Committee on Drugs and Contrast Media, 2023; El-Zaatari et al., 2019).

**Pre-infusion education** should address the risks of receiving an infusion prior to administration, emphasizing the signs and symptoms to immediately report. **Post-infusion education** should cover the possible progression of signs and symptoms of infiltration or extravasation, the need to protect the site from sunlight, and the frequency of follow-up visits to the provider as needed.

---

## 

# Quality Improvement

Infiltration and extravasation incidents causing harm or injury should be reviewed using adverse event reports and health record reviews for quality improvement opportunities (Ehmke, 2021; Melo et al., 2020; Karius & Colvin, 2021; Milcheski et al., 2018; Mecoli et al., 2022; Little et al., 2020).

Organizations should consider performing an investigation of each significant extravasation event (such as root cause analysis) to identify and implement needed quality improvement strategies.

# Prevention and Management of Nerve Injury in Vascular Access

## **Understanding Nerve Injury Risk**

Nerve injury during vascular access procedures, while relatively uncommon, represents a significant clinical concern with potentially lasting consequences for patients. Anatomical variations in veins, arteries, and nerves occur frequently across the population, meaning that even experienced clinicians cannot rely solely on expected anatomy when performing these procedures (Pires et al., 2018; Yammine, 2021; Mikuni et al., 2013).

### **Peripheral Venous Access Sites**

Certain anatomical locations carry elevated risk for nerve damage during peripheral venous access. The cephalic vein at the radial wrist poses a particular hazard due to its proximity to the superficial radial nerve. Similarly, the volar (inner) aspect of the wrist places the median nerve at risk of injury. At and above the antecubital fossa, multiple neural structures may be affected, including the median nerve, anterior interosseous nerve, and both the lateral and medial antebrachial nerves (Kim et al., 2014; Ramos, 2014; Voin et al., 2017; Wu & Liu, 2018; Mikuni et al., 2013; Rayegani & Azadi, 2014; Samarakoon et al., 2011; Mukai et al., 2020; Matsuo et al., 2017; Serra et al., 2018; Ohnishi, 2009; Moore et al., 2012; Oven & Johnson, 2017; Shields et al., 2021; Yeak et al., 2021; Wallis et al., 2020; Tsukuda et al., 2019; McCall, 2021; Desai et al., 2019; Becciolini et al., 2021).

### **Peripheral Arterial Access Sites**

Arterial catheterization carries its own set of neurological risks. The brachial artery lies in close anatomical relationship with the median nerve, making this site particularly hazardous. Radial artery access may result in injury to either the median nerve or the radial nerve (Imbrìaco, 2022; Wang, 2020).

### **Central Vascular Access Devices**

Although nerve injuries associated with CVADs occur rarely, documented cases involving axillary, subclavian, and internal jugular insertion sites have resulted in phrenic nerve injury, brachial plexus damage, and Horner's syndrome. These complications, while infrequent, demand vigilant clinical awareness (Moore et al., 2012; Desai et al., 2019; Björkander et al., 2019; Lenz et al., 2019; Butty et al., 2016; Zou, 2020; Lindgren et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2014; Paraskevas, 2011; Gozubuyuk et al., 2017).

---

# Strategies for Risk Reduction

### **Minimizing Venipuncture Attempts**

Multiple venipuncture attempts significantly increase the probability of nerve injury. Repeated peripheral and central venous access attempts, subcutaneous probing techniques, and multiple needle passes have all been associated with heightened risk (Rayegani & Azadi, 2014; Serra et al., 2018; Oven & Johnson, 2017; Desai et al., 2019; Zou, 2020; Gozubuyuk et al., 2017). Clinicians should therefore approach each access attempt with careful planning and appropriate resources to maximize first-attempt success.

### **Ultrasound Guidance**

Ultrasound-guided insertion represents a primary strategy for improving first-time insertion success while simultaneously allowing visualization of veins, arteries, and associated structures including nerves. This technology is particularly valuable when placing short or long peripheral catheters in patients with difficult intravenous access, when inserting peripheral arterial catheters, CVADs, and midline catheters (Ohnishi, 2009; Shields et al., 2021; Yeak et al., 2021; Imbrìaco, 2022; Wang, 2020; Zou, 2020; Paraskevas, 2011; Millington et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2018; Bardin-Spencer, 2020; Braverman, 2021; Flumignan et al., 2021; Raphael et al., 2023).

### **Insertion Angle Considerations**

When inserting a phlebotomy needle or peripheral intravenous catheter without ultrasound guidance, clinicians must assess vein depth and select an appropriate insertion angle. Steep angles increase the risk of penetrating the posterior vein wall and damaging underlying structures. For shallow veins and the veins of older adults, an angle of 5° to 15° is generally appropriate. Deeper veins may require steeper angles, but this should be approached cautiously (Ramos, 2014; McCall, 2021; Coulter, 2016).

### **Preferred Phlebotomy Sites**

For routine phlebotomy, the median cubital vein and the cephalic vein (excluding the first quarter of the forearm above the wrist) represent preferred sites. These veins are positioned closer to the skin surface and in anatomical locations where nerve damage and brachial artery puncture are less likely to occur (Ramos, 2014; Voin et al., 2017; Mikuni et al., 2013; Ohnishi, 2009; McCall, 2021).

Conversely, the medial and lateral portions of the antecubital fossa—specifically the basilic and median basilic veins—should be avoided due to their proximity to the median nerve and brachial artery. Injury to the median nerve in this region can result in loss of extension, flexion, and sensation in the hand and forearm.

The cephalic vein in the first quarter of the forearm (the region immediately above the wrist) should also be avoided (Kim et al., 2014; Samarakoon et al., 2011; Matsuo et al., 2017).

### **Needle Stabilization During Phlebotomy**

Needle movement during blood collection procedures increases the risk of neural contact and injury. Clinicians should use appropriate technique to minimize needle movement while attaching and removing blood collection tubes (Ramos, 2014; McCall, 2021; Fujii, 2013).

# Recognizing and Responding to Nerve Injury

### **Immediate Response to Paresthesia**

When a patient reports symptoms consistent with direct puncture nerve injury—including paresthesia, radiating electrical pain, tingling, burning, prickly sensations, or numbness—the clinician must immediately stop the insertion procedure and carefully remove the VAD or phlebotomy needle. The procedure should also be discontinued upon patient request or when patient behavior indicates severe pain (Voin et al., 2017; Wu & Liu, 2018; Oven & Johnson, 2017; Desai et al., 2019).

Following such an event, the responsible provider must be promptly informed of the patient's symptoms. Early recognition and intervention substantially improve prognosis for nerve injury. Consultation with an appropriate specialist, such as a hand specialist or neurologist, may be required. Importantly, the majority of venipuncture-related nerve injuries resolve within six months (Oven & Johnson, 2017; Shields et al., 2021; Tsukuda et al., 2019; Desai et al., 2019).

### **Nerve Compression and Compartment Syndrome**

Nerve compression injuries can develop through several mechanisms, and prevention requires attention to multiple factors. Infiltration and extravasation must be detected early to limit the volume of solution entering surrounding tissue. Bleeding at attempted and successful access sites must be controlled to prevent hematoma formation, which can compress adjacent nerves. Patients receiving anticoagulant therapy face elevated hematoma risk and require additional vigilance (Serra et al., 2018; Zou, 2020; Gozubuyuk et al., 2017; Blake et al., 2013).

Any VAD should be removed immediately when a patient reports pain, neuropathy, or weakness in the affected extremity during dwell time. Nerve injury following peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) insertion has been documented in the literature. Nerve compression can result from infiltrated intravenous solutions, hematoma, and edema associated with the inflammatory process of phlebitis and thrombophlebitis (Wu & Liu, 2018; Janakos et al., 2017; Seligman & Woodman, 2019; Pare & Moore, 2018).

The classic signs and symptoms of compartment syndrome include pain, pallor, paresthesia, paralysis, and pulselessness, with pain typically progressing from paresthesia to paralysis. Pallor and loss of peripheral pulse indicate advanced compartment syndrome. This condition constitutes a surgical emergency requiring fasciotomy within hours to prevent loss of the affected extremity. Clinicians should be aware that the hand contains numerous anatomical compartments compared to the wrist or forearm (Blake et al., 2013; Kistler et al., 2018; Wilson, 2011).

Risk factors for compartment syndrome from intravenous infiltration, while the condition itself is rare, include contrast media administration, pressurized infusion delivery, and patients with communication barriers such as those younger than three years old, patients with impaired sensation, and those with altered mentation (Pare & Moore, 2018).

# Special Clinical Considerations

### **Phrenic Nerve Injury**

Subclavian and jugular insertion sites can produce damage to the phrenic nerve, which manifests on chest radiograph as an elevated right hemidiaphragm. Associated findings may include right shoulder and neck pain, distended neck veins, and hiccups. Phrenic nerve injury can result from direct trauma associated with multiple needle insertions, compression from the catheter itself, intraventricular tip locations, hematoma, and infiltration or extravasation of infusing solutions. When phrenic nerve injury is identified, CVAD removal is indicated (Lindgren et al., 2019; Paraskevas, 2011).

### **Horner's Syndrome**

PICCs and catheters inserted via the internal jugular vein have been associated with vision-related changes suggestive of cervical sympathetic nerve inflammation, a constellation of findings known as Horner's syndrome. Clinical indicators include pupil constriction (miosis) and upper eyelid drooping (ptosis) (Butty et al., 2016; Zou, 2020).

Risk reduction strategies for Horner's syndrome include ultrasound-guided insertion, avoiding excessive head rotation during skin puncture, minimizing repeated insertion attempts, avoiding steep needle-to-skin angles during insertion, and applying appropriate compression to prevent hematoma formation following inadvertent carotid artery injury.

### **Complex Regional Pain Syndrome**

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) represents a chronic, debilitating condition characterized by ongoing neuropathic pain over a regional area. The pain is typically disproportionate to the original injury and progressively incorporates sensory, motor, and autonomic changes. Venipuncture-induced CRPS, while rare, presents diagnostic challenges because this syndrome frequently spreads to extremities that were not directly traumatized. Affected patients may require lifelong management including multiple pain medications, corticosteroids, nerve blocks, physical therapy, and surgical interventions such as sympathectomy (Elahi & Reddy, 2014; Pruthi et al., 2016).

# Vascular Access Device Occlusion

## **Prevention, Assessment, and Management**

### **Definition of Patency**

A vascular access device (VAD) is considered patent when the clinician can successfully flush all catheter lumens without encountering resistance, following confirmation of blood return from each lumen. Establishing patency through this dual confirmation—aspiration followed by flushing—represents the standard for verifying device functionality prior to therapeutic use.

### **1.2 Guiding Philosophy for Occlusion Management**

When occlusion occurs, catheter salvage should be prioritized over removal whenever clinically appropriate. The selection of catheter-clearing agents must be guided by systematic assessment of the probable occlusion etiology. If initial interventions fail to restore function and the device remains clinically necessary, escalation pathways should be pursued, including consultation with vascular access specialty teams, radiographic evaluation of catheter tip positioning and flow dynamics, and pharmaceutical consultation to determine occlusion causation.

---

## 

## **Occlusion Prevention**

Effective prevention requires attention to multiple domains of VAD management. Clinicians should adhere to evidence-based flushing and locking protocols, as inadequate maintenance remains a primary contributor to occlusive complications.

### **2.1 Mechanical Prevention**

Catheter dislodgement—whether partial or complete—significantly increases occlusion risk. Appropriate securement techniques must be employed consistently to maintain catheter position and prevent migration that can predispose to thrombotic or mechanical obstruction.

### **2.2 Chemical Incompatibility Prevention**

Incompatible mixing of intravenous solutions and medications represents a preventable cause of catheter occlusion. Clinicians should verify compatibility whenever two or more drugs or solutions are administered together, whether combined in the same container, given as intermittent short-term infusions, delivered via manual injection, or infused concomitantly through the same VAD. Pharmacist consultation or reference to evidence-based compatibility databases is essential when compatibility status is uncertain. In the absence of documented compatibility data, the mixture should be treated as incompatible (Gorski, 2018; Canadian Vascular Access Association, 2019).

Medications and solutions with elevated precipitation risk warrant particular vigilance. Alkaline agents such as phenytoin, diazepam, ganciclovir, acyclovir, ampicillin, imipenem, and heparin may precipitate when mixed inappropriately. Acidic preparations including vancomycin and parenteral nutrition formulations pose similar concerns. The combination of ceftriaxone with calcium gluconate is specifically contraindicated. Parenteral nutrition solutions containing elevated calcium and phosphate concentrations carry inherent mineral precipitation risk (Gorski, 2018; Cancer Nurses Society of Australia, 2021).

Between infusions, a gentle pulsatile flush using 10 mL of preservative-free 0.9% sodium chloride should be performed. Pediatric and neonatal patients, as well as those with fluid restrictions, require appropriately reduced volumes. When multiple incompatible infusions are necessary, separate catheter lumens should be utilized when available.

### **2.3 Lipid-Related Occlusion Prevention**

Administration of lipid-containing infusions creates potential for lipid residue accumulation within the catheter lumen. When lipid residue buildup is suspected, preventive strategies such as increased flushing frequency should be implemented proactively (Cancer Nurses Society of Australia, 2021; Canadian Vascular Access Association, 2019).

---

## 

## **Clinical Assessment of Occlusion**

### **3.1 Signs and Symptoms**

Clinicians should maintain vigilance for indicators of potential VAD occlusion, which may manifest as inability to withdraw blood or sluggish blood return; sluggish flow, resistance to flushing, or complete inability to flush the lumen or infuse fluid; frequent occlusion alarms triggered on electronic infusion pumps; visible swelling or solution leaking at the infusion site; and, in hemodialysis central vascular access devices, absent or insufficient blood flow return (Gorski, 2018; Canadian Vascular Access Association, 2019; Ullman et al., 2020).

### **3.2 Patency Verification Protocol**

Before administering any solution through a VAD, patency should be confirmed through aspiration for blood return followed by flushing each lumen with preservative-free 0.9% sodium chloride. When aspiration fails to yield blood return, clinicians should conduct a comprehensive site and clinical assessment. Alternating gentle aspiration with gentle instillation of small saline volumes may be attempted with appropriate caution (Cancer Nurses Society of Australia, 2021; Giordano et al., 2015).

If standard aspiration proves unsuccessful but the catheter flushes without difficulty, using a smaller-barrel syringe for blood withdrawal may improve results. Smaller syringes generate reduced negative pressure during aspiration, potentially facilitating blood return in partially obstructed lumens (Canadian Vascular Access Association, 2019).

### **3.3 Alternative Patency Assessment**

Circumstances exist where blood return assessment may be contraindicated or persistently unsuccessful. In hemodynamically unstable patients dependent on vasopressor delivery, for example, patency evaluation may require alternative approaches. Assessment parameters in such scenarios include ongoing clinical response to infusing medications, absence of resistance during flushing, site evaluation findings, and patient symptom reports.

When blood return remains absent or unassessable, the frequency of site assessment for complications such as infiltration and extravasation should be increased. If a peripheral intravenous catheter without confirmed blood return is being used for vesicant administration, transition to a more appropriate VAD or central vascular access device should be planned when clinically feasible. Central vascular access device occlusion requires prompt evaluation and treatment; if patency cannot be restored, consultation with the provider regarding removal and replacement is indicated.

## 

## **Systematic Occlusion Evaluation**

### **4.1 Identifying the Cause**

Thorough assessment of the infusions, injections, flushing procedures, and other events preceding occlusion is essential for determining etiology and selecting appropriate intervention.

### **4.2 External Mechanical Causes**

External mechanical factors should be ruled out or resolved first, requiring assessment of the entire infusion system from the administration set to the insertion site beneath the dressing. Specific assessment points include the securement device or suture for catheter constriction, kinked or clamped catheters or administration sets, obstructed or malfunctioning filters or needleless connectors, changes in external catheter length, and malposition of implanted port access needles.

When external factors are suspected, add-on devices should be removed and catheter patency assessed by attaching a syringe directly at the hub before applying new add-on devices. External kinks may resolve with catheter repositioning and sterile dressing reapplication. Malpositioned or occluded implanted port access needles require replacement (Gorski, 2018; Canadian Vascular Access Association, 2019; Denton et al., 2016; Kumwenda et al., 2018).

For withdrawal occlusions (inability to obtain blood return despite ability to infuse), short-term resolution may be attempted through patient repositioning such as raising the arm, having the patient cough, or instructing deep breathing to alter catheter position within the vessel. Persistent or recurrent withdrawal occlusion warrants further investigation (Cancer Nurses Society of Australia, 2021; Giordano et al., 2015).

Catheter damage indicators including bulging, leaking, or swelling along the central vascular access device pathway require assessment, with repair or replacement as indicated.

### **4.3 Internal Mechanical Causes (Central Vascular Access Devices)**

Internal mechanical causes specific to central vascular access devices include pinch-off syndrome, secondary catheter malposition, catheter-associated deep vein thrombosis, implanted vascular access port failure, and kinking related to tissue and vascular anatomy. Movement of the head and neck may cause kinking in catheters inserted via the internal or external jugular vein.

Pinch-off syndrome should be suspected when external catheter length has changed, when the patient reports arm or shoulder discomfort, when arrhythmias are observed, or when rolling the shoulder or raising the ipsilateral arm is required to allow flow or obtain blood return. Testing involves gently flushing the catheter with 10 mL of preservative-free 0.9% sodium chloride (reduced volumes for pediatric and neonatal patients) while asking the patient to raise the ipsilateral arm and roll the shoulder backward. If flow demonstrates dependence on arm position, pinch-off syndrome should be investigated through appropriate radiographic studies (Ast & Ast, 2014).

Suspected malposition, pinch-off syndrome, or catheter damage requires provider collaboration for management.

### **4.4 Thrombotic Occlusion**

Thrombotic occlusion should be suspected when visible blood appears in the catheter or add-on devices, when blood cannot be aspirated, or when flow becomes sluggish. Thrombotic occlusions may be intraluminal, arising from fibrin or clot formation within the catheter, or extraluminal, related to fibrin tail, fibrin sheath or sleeve formation, or mural thrombus (Cancer Nurses Society of Australia, 2021; Canadian Vascular Access Association, 2019; Gorski, 2018).

### **4.5 Chemical Occlusion**

Chemical occlusion should be suspected based on the types of medications or solutions administered, the duration of drug contact within the catheter, any visible precipitate observed in the catheter or administration set, infusion rate history, dilution properties and sequences, light exposure, and flushing frequency.

Calcium phosphate precipitation risk increases when calcium or phosphate concentrations in parenteral nutrition solutions are elevated, in fluid-restricted parenteral nutrition formulations, or when the calculated calcium phosphate solubility product falls below 75 mmol²/L² (Zheng et al., 2019).

Lipid residue occlusion should be suspected when infusing total nutrient admixture containing lipid concentration greater than 10%. If thrombolytic therapy proves unsuccessful in restoring patency, chemical occlusion should be considered as the likely etiology (Zheng et al., 2019; Canadian Vascular Access Association, 2019).

### **4.6 Contrast Studies**

For persistent or recurring unresolved central vascular access device occlusion, contrast study should be considered to evaluate catheter integrity, position, and flow dynamics (Canadian Vascular Access Association, 2019; Ullman et al., 2020).

---

## 

## **Treatment and Catheter Clearance**

### **5.1 Interdisciplinary Collaboration**

The patient's medication record should be reviewed in collaboration with pharmacy services to determine the appropriate intervention and catheter clearance agent selection (Gorski, 2018).

### **5.2 Treatment of All Affected Lumens**

In multilumen central vascular access devices, all catheter lumens demonstrating partial, withdrawal, or complete occlusion require treatment. An occluded lumen should never be left untreated simply because another lumen remains functional. Prolonged fibrin formation within untreated lumens constitutes a risk factor for catheter-associated bloodstream infection (Doellman et al., 2015; Gorski, 2018).

### **5.3 General Principles**

Excessive force should be avoided when instilling catheter clearance agents to minimize risk of catheter damage. Prompt resolution of suspected thrombotic occlusion or occlusion of unknown etiology improves thrombolytic efficacy in central vascular access devices and may avoid or delay the need for catheter replacement (Canadian Vascular Access Association, 2019; Nephrology CEN & Canadian Hemodialysis Access Coordinators Network, 2015; Kumwenda et al., 2019).

### **5.4 Thrombolytic Therapy for Thrombotic Occlusion**

Before initiating thrombolytic therapy, risks and benefits should be assessed. Circumstances warranting consideration of catheter removal or replacement rather than thrombolysis include contraindications to thrombolytic agents and patients with catheter-associated sepsis due to candidemia or Staphylococcus aureus infection (Cancer Nurses Society of Australia, 2021; Canadian Vascular Access Association, 2019).

#### **5.4.1 Tissue Plasminogen Activator Administration**

Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA, alteplase) should be instilled into the catheter lumen according to manufacturer directions for use. If the initial attempt is unsuccessful, one additional attempt may be made (Cancer Nurses Society of Australia, 2021; Giordano et al., 2015; Gnannt et al., 2019; Steere et al., 2018).

Thrombolytic administration for catheter occlusion is appropriate across all healthcare settings, including community and long-term care environments. All infusions should be stopped prior to and during thrombolytic agent dwell time when possible, particularly when treating suspected fibrin tail or sheath, to optimize thrombolysis and facilitate contact between the thrombolytic agent and thrombus or fibrin on both intraluminal and extraluminal catheter surfaces (Cancer Nurses Society of Australia, 2021; Canadian Vascular Access Association, 2019; Gorski, 2018; Scott et al., 2017).

Lower doses of tPA (such as 1 mg/mL) have demonstrated effectiveness in lumens requiring 1 mL or less volume, and cryopreserved aliquots have shown efficacy. However, randomized controlled trials are needed to definitively establish alternate dosing efficacy (Giordano et al., 2015; Scott et al., 2017; Jafari et al., 2018; Massmann et al., 2015; Mendes et al., 2015; Sapienza & Ciaschini, 2015).

For neonatal and pediatric patients weighing 30 kg or less, the instilled volume should equal 110% of the catheter priming volume (Cancer Nurses Society of Australia, 2021; Canadian Vascular Access Association, 2019; Da Costa et al., 2019).

#### **5.4.2 Alternative Thrombolytic Agents**

Alternative agents including urokinase, reteplase, tenecteplase, and alfimeprase have demonstrated effectiveness in smaller studies. Additional safety data and comparative research are recommended to establish relative efficacy, safety profiles, and cost considerations among different thrombolytic agents (Cancer Nurses Society of Australia, 2021; Canadian Vascular Access Association, 2019; Kumwenda et al., 2018; Kennard et al., 2017; Anderson et al., 2013; Chang et al., 2017; Pollo et al., 2016; Ragsdale et al., 2014; Song et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2023).

#### **5.4.3 Alternative Administration Methods**

For persistent or recurring occlusions not resolved by standard instillation, alternative methods may be considered: the push method administered over 30 minutes; low-dose infusion relative to patient weight delivered over 30 minutes to 3-4 hours; or dual syringe and implanted port access needle techniques (Canadian Vascular Access Association, 2019; Kumwenda et al., 2018, 2019; Ragsdale et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2023).

#### **5.4.4 Dwell Time**

Thrombolytic agents should remain in the catheter lumen for the duration specified in manufacturer directions for use or as defined by organizational policies, procedures, and practice guidelines.

#### **5.4.5 Thrombolytic Use in Midline Catheters**

Limited retrospective evidence supports tPA use for managing thrombotic occlusions in midline peripheral catheters. Off-label thrombolytic use for midline catheter restoration should proceed with caution and only after careful assessment of continued vascular access need and exclusion of catheter malfunction from other causes. Potential etiologies requiring exclusion before considering thrombolysis include vessel thrombus (evidenced by leaking at the insertion site), infiltration or extravasation (assessed through swelling, discoloration, subcutaneous fluid on ultrasound, and pain evaluation), and catheter malposition resolvable through repositioning (such as migration into a vein valve or lodging against the vessel wall). When these causes have been excluded and occlusion within or at the catheter tip is determined to be the etiology, tPA administration may be considered according to provider order when supported by organizational practice (Hawes, 2020; Rizk et al., 2022).

### **5.5 Catheter Clearance Agents for Chemical Occlusion**

Suspected chemical occlusion from medication precipitate or lipid residue may be addressed using catheter-clearance agents instilled based on catheter lumen priming volume and allowed to dwell for 20 to 60 minutes.

For acidic drug precipitates (pH 1-5), L-cysteine 50 mg/mL or 0.1 N hydrochloric acid have been utilized. Alkaline drug precipitates (pH 9-12) may respond to sodium bicarbonate 8.4% or sodium hydroxide 0.1 mmol/L. Parenteral nutrition and calcium phosphate precipitates have been treated with sodium hydroxide 0.1 mmol/L as first-line therapy or L-cysteine hydrochloride 50 mg/mL (Cancer Nurses Society of Australia, 2021; Canadian Vascular Access Association, 2019; Gorski, 2018; Giordano et al., 2015; Zheng et al., 2019).

Lipid residue has been addressed with sodium hydroxide 0.1 mmol/L or 70% ethanol. Systematic review evidence suggests sodium hydroxide may be more effective than ethanol, though trial research and observational studies have yielded mixed findings (Canadian Vascular Access Association, 2019; Gorski, 2018; Giordano et al., 2015; Zheng et al., 2019; Nephrology CEN & Canadian Hemodialysis Access Coordinators Network, 2015; LaRusso et al., 2021; Mokha et al., 2017; Wolf et al., 2018).

Repeat instillation of the catheter-clearance agent may be performed one additional time if necessary (Cancer Nurses Society of Australia, 2021; Canadian Vascular Access Association, 2019).

### **5.6 Post-Treatment Protocol**

Following appropriate dwell time of any catheter clearance agent, degradation products must be aspirated and discarded prior to flushing the lumen to assess restored patency.

Evidence supporting more than two doses of thrombolytic therapy is limited. Before considering additional thrombolytic doses, further assessment as described in the following section is recommended.

---

## 

## **Management of Unresolved Occlusion**

When catheter patency cannot be restored through standard interventions, alternative approaches should be considered.

### **6.1 Advanced Interventions**

Radiography may be employed to rule out catheter tip malposition. Referral to interventional radiology enables contrast study evaluation or procedural interventions including internal snare removal of fibrin, ablation of implanted central vascular access devices, catheter exchange with fibrin sheath disruption, or central venous angioplasty (Cancer Nurses Society of Australia, 2021; Canadian Vascular Access Association, 2019; Zheng et al., 2019; Pabon-Ramos et al., 2019).

### **6.2 Thrombosis Evaluation**

Collaboration with the healthcare team and vascular access specialty services (when available) is essential for investigation to rule out catheter-associated thrombosis. Venous thrombosis is a significant predictor of thrombolytic instillation treatment failure (Cancer Nurses Society of Australia, 2021; Canadian Vascular Access Association, 2019; Ullman et al., 2020; Steere et al., 2018).

### **6.3 Catheter Removal**

When all restoration efforts prove unsuccessful, catheter removal may become necessary. Alternative vascular access planning should proceed as clinically indicated.

---

## 

## **Post-Thrombolysis Monitoring**

Patients who have received thrombolytic therapy require monitoring for signs of catheter-related infection or catheter-related thrombosis. Clinicians should recognize that bacteria may adhere to thrombi within and around central vascular access devices, creating potential for infection development (Cancer Nurses Society of Australia, 2021; Canadian Vascular Access Association, 2019; Ullman et al., 2020; Steere et al., 2018).

---

## 

## **Quality Improvement and Outcomes Monitoring**

### **8.1 Outcome Tracking**

Outcomes requiring systematic monitoring include known and suspected occlusion causes, treatment success and failure rates, and other relevant metrics. Barriers to implementing occlusion prevention strategies and interventions should be identified, with appropriate strategies developed to address them through policy development, procedural refinement, and clinician education and training programs.

### **8.2 Advancing Technology**

Improvements in catheter materials may reduce complications including occlusion and thrombosis. In patient populations experiencing elevated occlusion or thrombosis incidence, consideration may be given to devices constructed from novel or alternative materials as a preventive strategy. Definitive trial evidence is required before recommending routine or widespread adoption of such technologies (Moureau et al., 2022).

# Prevention, Recognition, and Management of Vascular Access Device-Related Infections

## **Terminology and Diagnostic Criteria**

### **2.1 Catheter-Associated Bloodstream Infection (CABSI)**

Catheter-associated bloodstream infection serves as a comprehensive term encompassing bloodstream infections that originate from either peripheral or central vascular access devices. Recognition that both device types can cause equally serious infections has led to the adoption of this unified terminology. Bloodstream infections related to vascular catheters can develop through four distinct pathways: transfer of microorganisms along the catheter tract during insertion, contamination at the catheter hub or lumen during routine access and manipulation, seeding from endogenous microorganisms already present in the bloodstream, and infusion of contaminated solutions or medications.

### **2.2 Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infection (CR-BSI)**

This diagnostic criterion provides definitive confirmation that the catheter serves as the infection source. Diagnosis requires isolation of the identical organism from both a blood culture and the catheter tip culture, with quantitative tip culture yielding greater than 15 colony forming units (CFUs). An alternative diagnostic approach utilizes differential time to positivity (DTP), which requires the same organism isolated from both a peripheral venous blood culture and a catheter lumen blood culture, with the catheter sample demonstrating positive growth at least two hours before the peripheral sample (Mermel et al., 2009; Timsit et al., 2018).

### **2.3 Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection (CLABSI)**

This surveillance definition identifies a primary bloodstream infection occurring in a patient with a central line in place on the day of infection onset or the preceding day, provided the patient had central access for more than two calendar days. Clinical teams should recognize that surveillance definitions may overestimate the true incidence of catheter-related infections and should not substitute for definitive diagnostic criteria when making treatment decisions (Buetti et al., 2022).

---

## 

# Fundamental Prevention Principles

### **3.1 Care Bundle Implementation**

Effective prevention of vascular access device infections requires implementation of comprehensive care bundles combined with an institutional culture that prioritizes safety and quality. These bundles address critical elements during both device insertion and ongoing maintenance phases. Essential components include verification that clinicians performing insertions possess documented competency through appropriate training and assessment programs. Institutions should consider consultation with vascular access specialty teams when basic prevention measures have failed to achieve acceptable infection rates, as these specialized services have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing catheter-associated infections (Martillo et al., 2020; Buetti et al., 2022).

Optimization of catheter lumen utilization helps minimize infection risk by reducing the number of access points requiring manipulation. Interdisciplinary coordination of medication scheduling can facilitate safe care delivery while using the minimum number of lumens necessary. Documentation systems should capture key aspects of insertion and post-insertion care in readily retrievable formats that support infection prevention surveillance and quality improvement efforts.

### **3.2 Collaborative Quality Improvement**

Multidisciplinary rounds and systematic audits serve as effective strategies for enhancing compliance with infection prevention protocols. Regular assessment of adherence to established practices allows identification of gaps and opportunities for improvement. Quality improvement initiatives incorporating standardized audit tools and feedback mechanisms have demonstrated sustained reductions in infection rates across diverse healthcare settings (Pate et al., 2022; Thate et al., 2020).

### **3.3 Site Selection Considerations**

Anatomical site selection for vascular access device placement significantly influences infection risk. Clinicians should evaluate patient-specific factors, anticipated duration of therapy, and intended uses when determining optimal insertion sites. Site selection decisions should balance infection risk against other considerations including thrombosis risk, patient comfort, and technical feasibility of device placement and maintenance.

---

## 

# Skin Antisepsis and Barrier Precautions

### **4.1 Pre-Insertion and Maintenance Antisepsis**

Appropriate skin antisepsis at the vascular access site prior to insertion and during routine care represents a cornerstone of infection prevention. Standardized protocols should specify antiseptic agents, application technique, and required drying time before device insertion or dressing application.

### **4.2 Chlorhexidine-Containing Dressings**

Evidence supports the use of chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG)-containing dressings for prevention of central line-associated bloodstream infections in patients over two months of age with short-term central venous access devices. This recommendation extends to oncohematological patients unless specific contraindications exist, such as known sensitivity or allergy to chlorhexidine (Safdar et al., 2014; Wei et al., 2019; Puig-Asensio et al., 2020).

Clinical judgment should guide decisions regarding CHG-containing dressings in patients with complicated dermatologic conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, graft-versus-host disease, burns, and anasarca. Sites with heavy exudate, immunocompromised patients, and infants or young children warrant careful consideration of risks and benefits. Manufacturers' directions for use should inform application decisions in these populations (Düzkaya et al., 2016; Levy et al., 2005).

For oncology patients receiving prolonged infusions exceeding four to six hours, chlorhexidine-containing dressings around needle insertion sites provide additional protection (Schulmeister, 2017). Studies in both inpatient and outpatient hemodialysis populations have demonstrated reduced catheter-related infection rates with CHG-containing dressing use (Apata et al., 2017). Limited evidence suggests silver-plated dressings may reduce central line-associated infections in intensive care settings, though this requires further validation (Karlnoski et al., 2019).

### **4.3 Chlorhexidine Bathing Protocols**

Daily chlorhexidine bathing represents an effective strategy for reducing catheter-associated bloodstream infections in patients with central venous access devices in place, including infants. Multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses support this intervention across diverse patient populations and healthcare settings (Choi et al., 2015; Musuuza et al., 2019; Scheier et al., 2021; Chapman et al., 2021).

Implementation in neonatal populations, particularly low-birthweight and premature infants, requires careful attention to skin integrity and the potential for cutaneous injury. Manufacturer instructions regarding application of chlorhexidine-impregnated cloths over transparent semipermeable membrane dressings and along administration set tubing should guide practice. Combining chlorhexidine bathing with nasal decolonization protocols may provide additive benefit in reducing infections (Samuelson et al., 2018).

# Device-Specific Prevention Strategies

### **5.1 Antimicrobial Catheters**

Antimicrobial-impregnated or coated catheters offer an additional preventive strategy for reducing catheter-associated bloodstream infections. These devices incorporate antimicrobial agents into or onto the catheter material to inhibit microbial colonization. Consideration of antimicrobial catheters is appropriate when standard prevention measures have proven insufficient or in patient populations at elevated infection risk (Lai et al., 2016; Gilbert et al., 2020; Kagan et al., 2019).

### **5.2 Needleless Connector Management**

Proper disinfection of needleless connectors before each access represents an essential element of intraluminal contamination prevention. Standardized protocols should specify the antiseptic agent, technique, and duration of friction application required to achieve adequate disinfection prior to connector use.

### **5.3 Antimicrobial Barrier Caps for Hemodialysis**

For patients receiving outpatient hemodialysis through central venous catheters, antimicrobial barrier caps provide a passive disinfection strategy that has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing bloodstream infection rates. Cluster-randomized trials support incorporation of these devices into standard care protocols for this population (Hymes et al., 2017; Brunelli et al., 2018; Weiss & Qureshi, 2021).

### **5.4 Prophylactic Antimicrobial Lock Solutions**

Antimicrobial catheter lock solutions warrant consideration for high-risk patients and for individuals with long-term central venous access who have experienced multiple catheter-associated infections despite optimal adherence to aseptic technique. Selection of lock solution formulation should consider the target pathogens, catheter compatibility, and potential for promoting antimicrobial resistance.

## 

# Clinical Assessment and Monitoring

### **6.1 Signs and Symptoms of Infection**

Systematic assessment of vascular access device insertion and exit sites for infection indicators forms an essential component of ongoing device surveillance. Clinical manifestations requiring evaluation include erythema, edema, pain, tenderness, purulent drainage, and induration at the exit site. For totally implanted devices and tunneled catheters, assessment extends to evaluation for fluid accumulation in the subcutaneous pocket, tunnel tenderness or induration, drainage, and skin breakdown overlying the device. Systemic manifestations including fever should prompt consideration of device-related infection (Nickel, 2020; Lladó Maura et al., 2023).

Clinicians should recognize that not all microorganisms produce local site symptoms and that absence of exit site abnormalities does not exclude the possibility of catheter-related infection. When signs or symptoms suggestive of vascular access device-related infection are identified, immediate notification of the responsible provider and initiation of appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic interventions is warranted.

### **6.2 Patient Education**

Patients with vascular access devices should receive education regarding infection risks, recognition of concerning signs and symptoms, and importance of promptly reporting changes to their healthcare team. Education should address any specific follow-up requirements related to their device type and clinical situation.

---

## 

# Device Removal Decisions

### **7.1 Peripheral Intravenous Catheters**

Peripheral intravenous catheters should be removed when patients develop signs of complication or failure including infection-related findings such as erythema extending at least one centimeter from the insertion site, induration, purulent exudate, or fever without another identifiable source. Patient reports of pain or tenderness associated with the catheter warrant prompt removal and evaluation (Chopra et al., 2015; Pearse et al., 2022).

Catheters inserted under emergent conditions without full adherence to aseptic non-touch technique should be replaced at the earliest clinically appropriate opportunity to minimize infection risk.

### **7.2 Central Vascular Access Devices**

Management decisions for central venous access devices suspected of infection require careful consideration of multiple factors. A functioning central device should not be removed solely on the basis of elevated body temperature without additional confirmatory evidence of catheter-related infection. Fever alone, in the absence of other findings, has low specificity for catheter infection and removal may unnecessarily deprive patients of essential vascular access (Mermel et al., 2009; Timsit et al., 2018).

When catheter-related infection is suspected, clinicians should assess the risks and benefits of device removal versus attempted catheter salvage. Relevant considerations include whether the device is a short-term or long-term catheter, the identity of the infecting organism, the severity of clinical illness, the availability of alternative vascular access sites, and the technical feasibility of inserting a replacement device. Infectious disease consultation can provide valuable guidance in complex cases (Corkum et al., 2017; Raad et al., 2016; Secco et al., 2021; Chaftari et al., 2018).

Indications for prompt catheter removal include clinical deterioration, persistent bacteremia despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and relapsing bloodstream infection. When central access remains necessary, timing of new catheter insertion at an alternative site should reflect collaborative decision-making that weighs patient-specific risks, benefits, and ongoing vascular access requirements (Chopra et al., 2015; Buetti et al., 2022).

### **7.3 Guidewire Exchange Considerations**

Guidewire exchange should not be used to replace a non-tunneled central venous catheter suspected of infection. This approach risks introducing organisms along the new catheter tract and is not recommended in the setting of suspected catheter-related infection (O'Grady et al., 2011).

In situations where alternative vascular access sites are severely limited or when bleeding disorders make new site puncture hazardous, careful assessment of risks versus benefits may support consideration of catheter exchange procedures. If exchange is undertaken under these circumstances, use of an antimicrobial-impregnated replacement catheter may reduce subsequent infection risk (Mermel et al., 2009; Timsit et al., 2018).

## 

# Diagnostic Evaluation

### **8.1 Culture Collection Principles**

When catheter-associated bloodstream infection is suspected, appropriate diagnostic evaluation enables accurate identification of the infection source and guides antimicrobial therapy selection. Blood cultures obtained before initiating empirical antimicrobial treatment provide optimal diagnostic yield.

Routine culture of vascular access device tips upon removal is not recommended in the absence of suspected infection. Catheter colonization detected through routine surveillance cultures may prompt inappropriate antimicrobial therapy and contribute to emergence of resistant organisms. Additionally, tip cultures primarily identify organisms on the extraluminal catheter surface and may not detect intraluminal contamination (Buetti et al., 2022; Mermel et al., 2009; Timsit et al., 2018).

### **8.2 Culture Methods for Suspected Infection**

When a short-term central venous catheter, peripheral intravenous catheter, or arterial catheter is suspected as the infection source, the catheter tip should be cultured upon removal using semiquantitative (roll-plate) or quantitative (sonication) methods. For pulmonary artery catheters, the introducer sheath tip should be submitted for culture. When an implanted vascular access port is removed for suspected infection, both the reservoir contents and catheter tip should be cultured (Mermel et al., 2009; Timsit et al., 2018).

Purulent exudate from peripheral or central device exit sites should be collected for culture to identify causative fungi or bacteria and guide empirical antimicrobial selection. Such cultures help determine whether gram-positive, gram-negative, or fungal pathogens are present (Buetti et al., 2022; Pate et al., 2022).

### **8.3 Paired Blood Culture Technique**

Definitive diagnosis of catheter-related bloodstream infection requires paired blood samples collected from the catheter and a peripheral vein before antimicrobial therapy initiation. This approach enables application of diagnostic criteria that confirm the catheter as the infection source. Catheter-related bloodstream infection is the likely diagnosis when clinical signs of sepsis are present without an alternative obvious source and one of the following laboratory findings is demonstrated:

Positive semiquantitative culture (greater than 15 colony forming units) or quantitative culture (equal to or greater than 1,000 colony forming units) from a catheter segment, with the identical organism isolated from peripheral blood culture. Alternatively, simultaneous quantitative blood cultures demonstrating a ratio of at least 3:1 when comparing organism concentration in catheter-drawn versus peripherally-drawn samples supports the diagnosis. Differential time to positivity, with catheter cultures becoming positive more than two hours before peripheral cultures, provides additional diagnostic evidence (Mermel et al., 2009; Garcia et al., 2015; Karnatak et al., 2019).

### **8.4 Specimen Collection Quality**

The accuracy of blood culture diagnostics depends critically on specimen collection technique. Contamination of blood cultures with skin flora can produce false-positive results that complicate clinical interpretation and may lead to unnecessary catheter removal or antimicrobial therapy. Institutions should monitor blood culture contamination rates as a quality indicator and implement targeted interventions when contamination exceeds acceptable thresholds (Garcia et al., 2015; Santos et al., 2019).

### **8.5 Infusate Contamination**

Though uncommon, contamination of infusate solutions should be considered as a potential infection source. Parenteral solutions, intravenous medications, and blood products can become contaminated either during manufacturing (intrinsic contamination) or during preparation and administration in the clinical setting (extrinsic contamination). Parenteral nutrition preparations require particular attention given their composition provides favorable conditions for microbial growth (O'Grady et al., 2011).

# Special Population Considerations

### **9.1 Pediatric Patients**

Prevention and management of vascular access device infections in pediatric populations requires attention to developmental considerations, differences in skin integrity, and age-appropriate care practices. Chlorhexidine-containing products should be used with appropriate caution in neonates and infants, particularly those who are premature or low birthweight, given increased risk of cutaneous toxicity. Quality improvement initiatives targeting pediatric populations have demonstrated that central line-associated bloodstream infection rates can be significantly reduced through standardized bundle implementation (Bierlaire et al., 2021; Khieosanuk et al., 2022; Ardura et al., 2021).

### **9.2 Oncology and Immunocompromised Patients**

Patients with hematologic malignancies, those receiving chemotherapy, and immunocompromised individuals face elevated risks for catheter-associated infections and may experience more severe consequences. Prevention bundle implementation adapted to ambulatory oncology settings has demonstrated effectiveness in these populations. Decisions regarding catheter salvage versus removal in the setting of infection require careful consideration of the patient's underlying condition, treatment requirements, and vascular access limitations (Ardura et al., 2021).

### **9.3 Hemodialysis Patients**

Patients receiving hemodialysis through central venous catheters represent a population at particularly elevated risk for bloodstream infections. Dedicated quality improvement programs, antimicrobial barrier caps, and chlorhexidine-containing dressings have all demonstrated effectiveness in reducing infection rates in this population. Sustained surveillance and intervention programs can achieve and maintain significant infection reductions in dialysis settings (Gork et al., 2019; Apata et al., 2017).

### **9.4 Staphylococcus aureus Bacteremia**

Management of vascular access in patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia requires particular attention given the serious complications associated with this organism. Retrospective data suggest that early peripherally inserted central catheter placement may be safe in patients with S. aureus bloodstream infection, though prospective validation is needed. Establishing safe, reliable vascular access in these patients should be prioritized while maintaining appropriate infection control precautions (Stewart & Runnegar, 2018).

## 

# Key Recommendations

Prevention of vascular access device-related infections requires a multifaceted approach combining evidence-based insertion and maintenance practices with systematic surveillance and quality improvement. Care bundles addressing hand hygiene, maximal barrier precautions, appropriate skin antisepsis, optimal site selection, and prompt removal of unnecessary devices form the foundation of prevention efforts.

Chlorhexidine-containing dressings provide additional protection against central line-associated infections for most patients with short-term central access. Daily chlorhexidine bathing offers a supplementary strategy for reducing catheter-associated infections across diverse patient populations. Specialized devices including antimicrobial-impregnated catheters and barrier caps may benefit specific populations or situations where standard measures have proven insufficient.

Clinical assessment should include systematic evaluation for infection signs and symptoms, with recognition that some infections may not produce local manifestations. Diagnostic evaluation of suspected catheter-related bloodstream infection should employ paired blood cultures to enable definitive diagnosis. Catheter removal decisions require individualized assessment weighing infection severity, pathogen identity, alternative access availability, and patient-specific factors.

Ongoing quality improvement efforts, including collaborative rounds, compliance audits, and outcome surveillance, support sustained achievement of infection prevention goals. Institutional cultures that prioritize safety, combined with clinician competency in vascular access practices, create the foundation for minimizing the burden of these preventable infections.

# Catheter Damage, Embolism, Repair, and Exchange

## **Core Standards**

**Standard 1:** Preventative strategies must be implemented to maintain catheter integrity and reduce the risk of catheter damage across all care settings.

**Standard 2:** Prior to undertaking any catheter repair or exchange procedure, clinicians must perform a comprehensive assessment of the patient's risk-to-benefit ratio and ongoing vascular access requirements.

---

## 

# Prevention of Catheter Damage

### **1.1 Fundamental Principles of Catheter Preservation**

Maintaining catheter integrity requires attention to mechanical, procedural, and patient-related factors throughout the device's lifespan. The following practices form the foundation of catheter damage prevention.

**Syringe Selection and Flushing Technique.** When assessing VAD function, clinicians should use a syringe with a minimum 10-mL diameter barrel. This larger syringe size generates lower pressure per unit of force applied, reducing the risk of catheter rupture. Under no circumstances should force be applied against resistance during flushing or aspiration, as this creates excessive intraluminal pressure that may compromise catheter integrity (Wouters et al., 2019; Canadian Vascular Access Association, 2019).

**Power Injection Protocols.** Contrast media power injections must be limited exclusively to VADs and add-on devices that carry explicit manufacturer labeling indicating suitability for power injection. Using devices not rated for high-pressure injection significantly increases the risk of catheter rupture and subsequent complications (Saijo et al., 2019).

**Guidewire and Catheter Management During Insertion.** During the insertion process, clinicians must never withdraw the catheter or guidewire backward through the introducer needle. The needle bevel presents a sharp edge capable of shearing the wire or catheter material, potentially creating fragments that may embolize. Continuous control of the guidewire throughout the procedure is essential to prevent inadvertent wire embolism (Kassar et al., 2017).

**Mechanical Stress Reduction.** Catheters should be protected from stretch forces, repeated bending at the same location, and friction. For devices with integrated clamps, rotating the clamp position along the catheter prevents continuous pressure on a single segment, which can weaken the material over time (Wouters et al., 2019).

### **1.2 Anatomical Considerations for Insertion Site Selection**

The selection of insertion site significantly influences long-term catheter integrity. For implanted vascular access port placement, ultrasound-guided internal jugular vein cannulation is preferred over subclavian approaches when clinically feasible. The subclavian approach carries inherent risk of pinch-off syndrome, a mechanical complication occurring when the catheter becomes compressed between the clavicle and first rib. When subclavian insertion is necessary, care must be taken to avoid acute catheter angulation at the internal jugular vein entry point (Kridis et al., 2019; Li et al., 2017).

### **1.3 Long-Term Surveillance**

For patients with long-dwelling CVADs, including implanted ports, annual chest radiograph assessment should be considered to evaluate catheter position and structural integrity. Clinical evidence suggests that younger patient age, femoral catheter placement, and extended dwell times are associated with increased catheter fracture risk (Ai et al., 2020; Kridis et al., 2019).

### **1.4 Procedural Precautions During Insertion and Removal**

Multiple opportunities for inadvertent catheter damage exist during insertion and removal procedures. Clinicians must exercise vigilance to avoid accidental puncture of the catheter with needles or scalpels, application of excessively tight sutures that may compromise catheter integrity, positioning CVADs in locations prone to mechanical compression, incorrect attachment of catheters to port bodies, and excessive traction against resistance during removal (Matton et al., 2022).

### **1.5 Patient and Caregiver Education**

Comprehensive education for patients, caregivers, and all members of the healthcare team is essential for catheter preservation. Educational content should address the prohibition against flushing or infusing against resistance, avoidance of sharp objects near the catheter, prevention of pulling or tension on the external catheter segment, use of gauze padding when applying clamps (if a designated clamping sleeve is unavailable), rotation of clamp placement to distribute mechanical stress, protection of external catheters with appropriate clothing, and avoidance of friction from items such as backpacks, shoulder straps, stiff collars, or jewelry.

Clamps should only be applied at designated clamping sleeves when present. Luer-lock connectors must be attached to catheter hubs with care to prevent cross-threading or excessive torque that may damage the connection point (Wouters et al., 2019; Canadian Vascular Access Association, 2019; Gnannt et al., 2017).

## 

# Recognition and Assessment of Catheter Damage

### **2.1 Clinical Indicators of Catheter Compromise**

Catheter damage and potential embolism should be suspected when assessment reveals any of the following findings: visible catheter damage or fractured hub components, fluid leakage at the insertion or exit site, catheter dysfunction manifesting as inability to aspirate blood or frequent infusion pump alarms, localized pain or swelling along the CVAD pathway during infusion, paresthesia in the ipsilateral arm, abnormal radiographic findings, respiratory distress or new-onset arrhythmias.

Importantly, patients may remain asymptomatic despite significant catheter damage. Research indicates that as many as 20% of catheter fragments are missed on standard radiographic studies, emphasizing the need for high clinical suspicion (Kridis et al., 2019; Matton et al., 2022).

### **2.2 Sites of Catheter Separation**

Catheter integrity assessment must include evaluation of all potential separation points. Structural failure may occur at the lumen-hub junction, external connections and add-on devices, and internal junctions (particularly the septum-outflow tubing connection in implanted ports).

Separation at any of these sites may result in infiltration of infusates, bleeding, or in severe cases, exsanguination. All connections must be verified as secure. During hemodialysis procedures, all connections must remain visible throughout the treatment session to enable continuous assessment (Kridis et al., 2019).

### **2.3 Assessment Following Difficult Removal**

When VAD removal proves difficult or in the presence of catheter dysfunction, comprehensive patient assessment must be performed to evaluate for catheter damage and potential catheter, air, or thrombotic embolism. This assessment should be documented and appropriate interventions initiated as indicated (Kassar et al., 2017).

### **2.4 Recognition of Pinch-Off Syndrome**

Pinch-off syndrome represents a specific and potentially serious complication affecting catheters inserted via the subclavian vein. Early recognition is critical to prevent catheter fracture and embolization.

Clinical indicators of pinch-off syndrome include resistance during flushing or infusion that resolves with postural changes (such as rolling the shoulder, raising the arm, or moving the neck), blood return that varies with patient positioning, frequent or intermittent occlusion alarms, infraclavicular pain, discomfort during flushing or infusion, swelling at the insertion site, and any clinical finding that changes with arm or shoulder movement.

When pinch-off syndrome is suspected, radiographic confirmation should be obtained. The radiology requisition must specifically indicate "rule out pinch-off syndrome" to ensure proper arm positioning during the examination, as standard positioning may not reveal the compression (Kassar et al., 2017; Alizade et al., 2019; Li et al., 2017; Syltern et al., 2020).

# Management of Catheter Damage

### **3.1 Immediate Response**

Upon discovery of catheter damage—whether ballooning, fracture, rupture, or hub cracking—timely management is essential to prevent serious complications including catheter fracture and embolization, air embolism, hemorrhage, catheter-lumen occlusion, catheter-associated bloodstream infection (CABSI), and treatment interruption or failure.

The immediate response protocol requires stopping all infusions immediately, then clamping or sealing the damaged catheter between the exit site and the damaged area. This may be accomplished by closing an existing clamp, applying an additional clamp, covering the damaged area with occlusive dressing material, or folding and securing the external segment. The catheter must be clearly labeled "Do Not Use" pending definitive management (Wouters et al., 2019; Gnannt et al., 2017; Salonen et al., 2019; Chan et al., 2019).

### **3.2 Treatment Options**

Three primary management strategies exist for damaged catheters, each with distinct advantages and considerations.

**Catheter Repair.** Repair procedures may extend catheter longevity, preserve limited vascular access sites, and potentially reduce infection risk compared to catheter exchanges. This option is particularly valuable in patients with challenging vascular anatomy or limited access options (Salonen et al., 2019; Chan et al., 2019).

**Catheter Exchange.** Exchange over a guidewire is associated with reduced risk of technical insertion complications such as pneumothorax, hemothorax, and arterial puncture compared to de novo insertion. However, catheter exchange may carry higher thrombosis rates. Exchange should not be performed when infection is suspected in patients meeting criteria for catheter removal, specifically those with sepsis, hemodynamic instability, or persistent bacteremia beyond 72 hours of appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Of particular note, PICC exchanges have been associated with a two-fold increased risk of thrombosis compared to non-exchanged catheters (Gnannt et al., 2017; Park et al., 2018; Chopra et al., 2018; Calderwood, 2023).

**Catheter Removal and Replacement.** Complete removal with subsequent new catheter placement at a different site may be indicated based on clinical circumstances (Kridis et al., 2019; Gnannt et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017; Zens et al., 2019; Chan et al., 2019; Chopra et al., 2018; Pabon-Ramos et al., 2019; Rus et al., 2017).

### **3.3 Risk-Benefit Analysis**

Selection among management options requires systematic evaluation of multiple factors.

Patient-related considerations include age, venous integrity and available vascular access options, current clinical condition (with particular attention to immunocompromise, burns, transplant status, or confirmed/suspected infection), and patient and healthcare team preferences.

Therapy-related considerations include the remaining duration of required infusion therapy and the characteristics of prescribed infusates, particularly osmolarity and vesicant potential.

Catheter-related considerations include the current catheter location (particularly femoral placement), patency status, external catheter length, catheter material composition, extent of potential microbial exposure due to damage, anticipated changes in tip position following repair, proximity of damage to the exit site (repairs are generally contraindicated when damage occurs within 3.0 cm of the exit site or when less than 2.5-5.0 cm of undamaged catheter remains proximal to the bifurcation), persistent leakage following repair attempts, and history of previous repairs or exchanges.

Certain clinical situations generally contraindicate repair or exchange in favor of removal, including sepsis, endocarditis, and suppurative thrombophlebitis (Wouters et al., 2019; Gnannt et al., 2017; Salonen et al., 2019; Zens et al., 2019; Chan et al., 2019; Chopra et al., 2018).

### **3.4 Post-Procedure Requirements**

Following catheter repair (if the CVAD was withdrawn during the damage event or repair procedure) or catheter exchange, tip location must be confirmed radiographically or through other appropriate imaging technology before initiating or resuming prescribed therapies (Canadian Vascular Access Association, 2019).

When repair or exchange proves unsuccessful or inappropriate, collaboration with the healthcare team is required to arrange catheter replacement or removal as clinically indicated.

Post-procedural monitoring must include surveillance for catheter-related infection, persistent or new leakage, migration of any metallic components (such as repair stents), occlusion, and thrombosis (Gnannt et al., 2017; Salonen et al., 2019; Chan et al., 2019; Chopra et al., 2018).

# Catheter and Guidewire Embolism

### **4.1 Clinical Presentation**

Catheter or guidewire embolism should be suspected when patients exhibit palpitations or cardiac arrhythmias, dyspnea, cough, or thoracic pain, particularly when these symptoms cannot be attributed to the patient's primary disease or known comorbidities. Notably, some patients with catheter fragment embolization remain asymptomatic initially, with damage manifesting gradually over extended periods of device use (Kassar et al., 2017; Matton et al., 2022).

### **4.2 Post-Removal Inspection**

Following catheter or guidewire removal, the device must be examined for damage and potential fragmentation. The removed length should be compared to the documented inserted length. Any discrepancy or visible damage necessitates chest radiograph or further imaging evaluation to assess for retained fragments (Canadian Vascular Access Association, 2019).

### **4.3 Emergency Management of Confirmed or Suspected Embolism**

When catheter or guidewire embolism is confirmed or strongly suspected, immediate intervention is required.

**Patient Positioning.** Place the patient in the left lateral decubitus position with Trendelenburg positioning unless contraindicated by conditions such as elevated intracranial pressure, recent eye surgery, or severe cardiac or respiratory disease.

**Activity Restriction.** Minimize patient movement, particularly of the involved limb.

**Supportive Care.** Provide reassurance to the conscious patient while preparing for emergency intervention.

**Emergency Notification.** Immediately summon emergency medical assistance.

**Fragment Migration Prevention.** Applying pressure over the target vein at the involved limb may reduce the likelihood of fragment migration. When embolization is directly observed, immediate tourniquet application proximal to the site should be considered.

**Definitive Management.** The healthcare team must be notified promptly. Percutaneous interventional or surgical procedures are typically required for fragment retrieval to prevent further complications (Alizade et al., 2019; Canadian Vascular Access Association, 2019; Li et al., 2017; Salonen et al., 2019; Chopra et al., 2018).

---

## 

# Catheter Repair Procedures

### **5.1 Equipment and Technique**

Catheter repair must be performed using the manufacturer's catheter-specific repair kit according to the provided directions for use. When a device-specific repair kit is unavailable, alternative strategies such as catheter exchange or removal with replacement should be considered rather than attempting improvised repairs (Salonen et al., 2019; Zens et al., 2019; Chan et al., 2019).

### **5.2 Infection Prevention**

Surgical Aseptic Non-Touch Technique (Surgical-ANTT) must be maintained throughout all catheter repair procedures to minimize the risk of catheter-associated infection.

### **5.3 Post-Repair Protocol**

Following repair, the catheter must not be used for the time period specified in the manufacturer's repair instructions to allow adequate bonding of adhesive components between catheter segments. Prior to resuming catheter use, patency must be confirmed and the repair site inspected for any evidence of leakage (Salonen et al., 2019; Zens et al., 2019; Chan et al., 2019).

### **5.4 Ongoing Assessment**

Regular assessment of repaired catheters is essential to confirm the ongoing integrity of the repair and identify developing problems. Clinicians and patients should be informed that repaired catheters may not retain the same structural strength as the original intact catheter (Salonen et al., 2019).

### **5.5 Repair Failure Management**

When catheter repair fails, catheter exchange or replacement should be considered following a systematic risk-benefit analysis as outlined in Section 3.3 (Gnannt et al., 2017).

---

## 

# Catheter Exchange Procedures

### **6.1 General Principles**

Routine exchange of functioning CVADs without evidence of local or systemic complications is not indicated and should be avoided (Chopra et al., 2018).

### **6.2 Indications for Exchange**

Catheter exchange, including exchange of tunneled, cuffed catheters and implanted vascular access ports, may be considered when there is no evidence of active infection (Saleh et al., 2017).

In situations involving actual or suspected catheter-related infection (excluding septic shock or metastatic infection) where vascular access options are limited, CVAD exchange may be considered with specific precautions. Use of antimicrobial-impregnated, coated, or bonded catheters should be considered, along with administration of prophylactic antimicrobials. Limited evidence suggests that hemodialysis catheter revision utilizing a new tunnel and exit site while maintaining the same venotomy site may result in lower infection rates compared to standard catheter exchanges (Saleh et al., 2017).

### **6.3 Procedural Technique**

Surgical-ANTT must be maintained throughout the exchange procedure. Specific techniques to reduce the risk of air embolism during catheter exchange must be employed, including appropriate patient positioning, use of aerostatic sheaths when available, and meticulous attention to maintaining closed-system technique during the over-the-wire exchange (Hsu & Trerotola, 2015).

### **6.4 Post-Exchange Monitoring**

Following catheter exchange, monitoring must include assessment for bleeding or hematoma at the exit site, signs of infection, and recurrence of catheter malfunction (which may indicate an intact fibrin sheath compromising the new catheter) (Syltern et al., 2020).

# Prevention and Management of Air Embolism in Vascular Access

## **Clinical Significance**

Air embolism represents a potentially fatal complication of vascular access procedures and infusion therapy. When air enters the venous or arterial circulation, it can obstruct blood flow, leading to cardiopulmonary compromise, neurological injury, or death. The condition may arise during catheter insertion, routine infusion management, catheter exchange, or device removal. Prevention requires vigilant technique, appropriate equipment selection, and comprehensive education of all personnel involved in vascular access care.

Clinical events associated with air emboli have been documented across diverse procedural contexts, including contrast media administration, endoscopic procedures, guidewire-assisted interventions, sheath exchanges, arterial catheterization, neurosurgical procedures performed in upright positioning, cardiopulmonary bypass, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) circuits. Unsecured connections remain a common contributing factor across all settings.

---

## **Core Standards**

### **2.1 Connection Security**

All infusion system connections must incorporate luer-lock design to maintain secure attachment throughout therapy. This requirement applies universally to intravenous administration sets, syringes, needleless connectors, extension tubing, and any supplementary devices integrated into the infusion pathway. Luer-lock connections significantly reduce the risk of inadvertent disconnection that could permit air entry into the vascular system.

### **2.2 Air Removal Protocol**

Prior to initiating any infusion or connecting devices to a vascular access device, clinicians must completely purge air from all components of the administration system. This includes primary and secondary administration sets, syringes of any volume, needleless connectors, extension sets, and all add-on devices. No administration set containing air should be connected to any solution container or patient access point.

### **2.3 Education Requirements**

All individuals responsible for initiating or managing infusion therapy must receive comprehensive instruction covering three essential domains: recognition of air embolism signs and symptoms, implementation of preventive measures, and execution of critical emergency interventions when air embolism is suspected. This education requirement extends to clinical staff, patients receiving home infusion therapy, and designated caregivers who assist with infusion management.

---

## 

## **Prevention Strategies**

### **3.1 General Prevention Measures for All Vascular Access Devices**

Effective prevention of air embolism requires systematic attention to equipment preparation, patient positioning, and connection management throughout the duration of vascular access therapy.

**Equipment Preparation:** Every administration set and add-on device must be completely primed before connection to the vascular access device. Unprimed administration sets should never remain attached to solution containers, as this practice creates opportunity for air introduction when the set is subsequently connected to the patient. Equipment featuring integrated safety mechanisms provides additional protection; clinicians should preferentially select administration sets incorporating air-eliminating filters and electronic infusion pumps equipped with air sensor technology.

**Connection Management:** The vascular access device must be clamped before any manipulation involving administration set changes or needleless connector replacement. This simple practice prevents air aspiration during the brief interval when the system is open. All connections throughout the infusion pathway should be verified for security at regular intervals and whenever the system is accessed.

**Patient and Caregiver Guidance:** Patients and caregivers managing infusion therapy outside clinical settings require explicit instruction regarding the dangers of disconnecting or reconnecting any portion of the infusion system without proper training. Only individuals who have demonstrated competency in intravenous administration techniques should perform these manipulations. Additionally, patients must understand that sharp objects such as scissors, hemostats, or razors should never be used near the catheter, as accidental laceration creates immediate risk of air entry.

### **3.2 Precautions During Central Vascular Access Device Procedures**

Insertion, exchange, and removal of central vascular access devices warrant heightened vigilance due to the proximity of these devices to central circulation and the larger caliber of the access pathway.

**Positioning Principles:** Patient positioning plays a critical role in preventing air entry during central line procedures. Positioning the patient so that the insertion or access site remains at or below the level of the heart reduces the pressure gradient that could draw air into the venous system. Air-occlusive techniques should be employed throughout insertion, use, maintenance, and removal procedures.

**Procedural Considerations:** Particular caution is warranted during catheter exchange procedures, sheath replacement, and any intervention requiring temporary opening of the vascular system. ECMO circuits present unique risks due to the high flow rates and multiple connection points inherent to extracorporeal circulation.

---

## 

## **Central Vascular Access Device Removal Protocol**

Removal of central vascular access devices represents a high-risk interval for air embolism, even when the catheter has been in place for extended periods. The skin-to-vein tract that develops around indwelling catheters can persist after device removal, providing a potential pathway for air entry. Fibrin sheath formation along the catheter further complicates this risk.

### **4.1 Patient Positioning**

Position the patient supine or in Trendelenburg position (head lower than feet) during central catheter removal, provided these positions are tolerated. This positioning ensures the insertion site remains at or below heart level, reducing the negative intrathoracic pressure gradient that could aspirate air through the removal site. Trendelenburg positioning is contraindicated in premature neonates and may not be tolerated by patients with certain cardiac or respiratory conditions.

Although air embolism specifically attributed to peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) removal has not been documented in published literature, theoretical risk exists due to the potential for an intact skin-to-vein tract and fibrin sheath formation. The same positioning precautions applied to other central venous catheters should therefore be extended to PICC removal.

### **4.2 Valsalva Maneuver**

Instruct the patient to perform a Valsalva maneuver (bearing down against a closed glottis) during catheter withdrawal. This action increases intrathoracic pressure, creating a positive pressure gradient that opposes air entry into the venous system.

The Valsalva maneuver is contraindicated in patients with supraventricular tachycardia, acute myocardial infarction, hemodynamic instability, aortic stenosis, carotid artery stenosis, glaucoma, or retinopathy. The maneuver produces significant increases in intra-abdominal and intrathoracic pressure that reduce cardiac output and alter blood pressure, making it potentially dangerous in these populations.

**Alternative Approaches:** When the Valsalva maneuver is contraindicated, place the patient in Trendelenburg position if tolerated. For patients who cannot tolerate Trendelenburg positioning, or for femoral catheter removal, use the supine position. In mechanically ventilated patients or those unable to follow instructions, time catheter removal to coincide with end expiration of the respiratory cycle.

### **4.3 Site Management After Removal**

Immediately upon catheter withdrawal, apply firm digital pressure using sterile dry gauze until complete hemostasis is achieved. Following hemostasis, apply petroleum-based ointment covered with gauze, then seal with a transparent semipermeable membrane dressing. This air-occlusive dressing should remain in place for a minimum of 24 hours to occlude the skin-to-vein tract and minimize risk of retrograde air embolism through the healing exit site.

### **4.4 Post-Removal Activity Restriction**

Encourage patients to remain in a flat or reclining position for 30 minutes following catheter removal when feasible. This recommendation acknowledges that the exit site may be at or near heart level in certain positions, and the intact skin-to-vein tract may require time to seal sufficiently to prevent air entry.

---

## 

## **Recognition of Air Embolism**

Air embolism should be immediately suspected when any of the following signs or symptoms develop suddenly in a patient with vascular access, particularly in temporal association with catheter manipulation, connection changes, or device removal:

**Respiratory Manifestations:** Dyspnea, gasping respirations, persistent coughing, breathlessness, chest pain, wheezing, and tachypnea reflect the cardiopulmonary consequences of air obstructing pulmonary circulation.

**Cardiovascular Signs:** Hypotension and tachyarrhythmias indicate hemodynamic compromise resulting from impaired cardiac output or direct cardiac air lock.

**Neurological Symptoms:** Altered mental status, headache, seizures, speech changes, facial asymmetry or changes in facial appearance, numbness, and paralysis suggest cerebral air embolism, either through paradoxical embolism across a patent foramen ovale or direct arterial introduction.

The clinical presentation reflects the volume of air introduced, the rate of introduction, and whether the embolism affects the venous or arterial circulation. Venous air embolism primarily produces cardiopulmonary symptoms, while arterial air embolism can affect any end-organ, with cerebral manifestations being most clinically apparent.

---

## 

## **Emergency Response Protocol**

### **6.1 Immediate Actions**

When air embolism is suspected, the first priority is preventing additional air from entering the circulation. If the vascular access device remains in place, immediately close, fold, clamp, or otherwise occlude the catheter. If the catheter has already been removed, cover the puncture site with an air-occlusive dressing or pad to seal the entry point.

### **6.2 Patient Positioning for Venous Air Embolism**

For suspected venous air embolism, immediately position the patient on their left side in Trendelenburg position (left lateral decubitus, head down). This positioning serves to trap air in the lower portion of the right ventricle, preventing it from entering the pulmonary circulation where it could cause complete obstruction. This position is contraindicated in patients with increased intracranial pressure, recent eye surgery, or severe cardiac or respiratory disease.

### **6.3 Patient Positioning for Arterial Air Embolism**

The management of arterial air embolism differs significantly from venous air embolism. Position the patient supine rather than in the left lateral position. The left lateral recumbent position does not prevent arterial air from entering systemic circulation, and head-down positioning may worsen cerebral edema in patients who have sustained cerebral air embolism.

### **6.4 Activation of Emergency Response**

In acute care settings, immediately activate the resuscitation team. In home care or alternative settings, call emergency medical services without delay. Concurrent with positioning interventions, clinicians should notify the responsible physician, ensure adequate vascular access for emergency medication administration, and initiate supplemental oxygen at 100% concentration if available. Support ventilation and circulation as clinically indicated.

### **6.5 Advanced Interventions**

Several advanced treatment modalities have demonstrated effectiveness in managing air embolism when available:

**Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy:** Reduces bubble size through increased ambient pressure and enhances tissue oxygenation. This therapy is particularly valuable for cerebral air embolism.

**Catheter Aspiration:** Direct aspiration of air through an indwelling central venous catheter may remove a portion of the air bolus before it distributes through the pulmonary circulation.

**Chest Compressions:** External chest compression may force air from larger pulmonary vessels into smaller arterial segments where it can be more readily absorbed, reducing the degree of circulatory obstruction.

---

## 

## **Diagnostic Evaluation**

When air embolism is suspected based on clinical presentation, diagnostic confirmation may be sought through several imaging and monitoring modalities. Transesophageal echocardiography provides direct visualization of air in cardiac chambers and is highly sensitive for detecting venous air embolism. Precordial Doppler ultrasonography can detect characteristic signals produced by intracardiac air. Computed tomography demonstrates air in the vasculature and can identify end-organ injury. Magnetic resonance imaging may reveal cerebral infarction patterns consistent with air embolism. Electrocardiography may show ischemic changes or arrhythmias. Standard ultrasound examination can assist in evaluating cardiac function and identifying air.

# Catheter-Associated Thrombosis

## **Definitions**

### **1.1 Catheter-Associated Thrombosis (CAT)**

Catheter-associated thrombosis refers to thrombus formation that develops as an inflammatory response to vessel wall injury caused by an indwelling vascular access device. On ultrasound examination, CAT appears as an anechoic or hypoechoic mass that partially or completely occludes the vessel lumen.

CAT is classified according to anatomical location (deep versus superficial veins) and clinical presentation (symptomatic versus asymptomatic). The majority of CAT cases are asymptomatic. Although overall rates remain relatively low, thrombotic complications can impair device function, delay treatment, necessitate anticoagulation therapy, cause premature device removal, increase healthcare costs, and potentially lead to post-thrombotic syndrome (Li et al., 2021; Chopra et al., 2013).

### **1.2 Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)**

Deep vein thrombosis involves thrombus formation within the deep venous system. In the upper extremity, this includes the brachial, axillary, subclavian, and internal jugular veins. In the lower extremity, affected vessels include the iliac, femoral, and popliteal veins. Diagnosis is established through compression ultrasonography, venography, or computed tomography imaging (Chopra et al., 2013; Li et al., 2021).

Upper extremity DVT (UE-DVT) frequently occurs in association with VADs placed in smaller arm vessels where blood flow velocity is reduced.

### **1.3 Superficial Vein Thrombosis (SVT)**

Superficial vein thrombosis affects the superficial venous system, including the basilic and cephalic veins in the upper extremity and the saphenous veins in the lower extremity.

### **1.4 Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)**

Venous thromboembolism encompasses both deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Some clinical studies also include superficial vein thrombosis within this category.

### **1.5 Fibroblastic Sleeve**

A fibroblastic sleeve is a sheath of connective tissue that forms around an indwelling catheter as part of the body's adaptive response to a foreign object. Unlike thrombus, this structure does not originate from the vessel wall. Histologically, it contains fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and collagen. While typically asymptomatic, a fibroblastic sleeve can cause catheter dysfunction if it obstructs the catheter tip (Trezza et al., 2021).

### **1.6 Post-Thrombotic Syndrome (PTS)**

Post-thrombotic syndrome is a chronic complication that may develop following venous thrombosis, most commonly after DVT. Clinical manifestations include persistent pain, tenderness, edema, and skin changes in the affected extremity. Endothelial injury from VAD insertion represents a potential contributing factor (Polen et al., 2015; Thiyagarajah et al., 2019).

---

## 

## **Risk Factor Identification**

Comprehensive risk assessment should be performed for all patients requiring vascular access to inform device planning, guide monitoring intensity, and determine whether thromboprophylaxis is indicated.

### **2.1 Patient-Related Risk Factors**

Multiple systemic conditions increase susceptibility to catheter-associated thrombosis. Active malignancy represents a significant risk factor, with thrombotic risk influenced by cancer type, tumor burden, and disease characteristics. Patients receiving chemotherapy face elevated risk compared to those not on active treatment (Leung et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2022; Farge et al., 2019).

Metabolic and endocrine conditions associated with increased CAT risk include diabetes mellitus and obesity (Simonetti et al., 2022). Inherited thrombophilias such as Factor V Leiden mutation, protein C deficiency, and protein S deficiency predispose patients to thrombotic events, although routine thrombophilia screening is not recommended for pediatric patients with catheter-associated DVT (Neshat-Vahid et al., 2016; Hansen et al., 2021).

Critical illness substantially elevates thrombotic risk across patient populations. Personal or family history of prior thrombosis should be considered during risk stratification (Leung et al., 2015; Tan et al., 2019).

Additional patient factors that influence CAT risk include SARS-CoV-2 infection, patient age (though this varies considerably across studies and populations), pregnancy, elevated triglycerides, elevated low-density lipoprotein levels, ethnicity (with higher risk reported in Black or African American populations), reduced functional status (as measured by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance scores), hospital readmission shortly after central vascular access device insertion, inadequate hydration and nutritional status, non-O blood types, and receipt of blood transfusions (Li et al., 2021; Tabatabaie et al., 2017; Jaffray et al., 2020; Sebolt et al., 2022; Frolova et al., 2022).

### **2.2 Device-Related Risk Factors**

Characteristics of the vascular access device and insertion technique significantly influence thrombotic risk. Catheter tip malposition outside the optimal target zone increases thrombus formation (Chen et al., 2021). A higher catheter-to-vessel ratio, reflecting a larger catheter diameter relative to vessel size, reduces blood flow around the device and promotes thrombus development (Balsorano et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020).

Additional device-related factors include reduced blood flow velocity in the vessel segment containing the VAD, endothelial injury from the catheter or infused solutions, multiple insertion attempts, prolonged device dwell time, increased arm circumference, greater vein depth from the skin surface, and presence of a concurrent VAD in the same venous system (Li et al., 2021; Chopra et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2020; Ingram, 2022; Kleidon et al., 2021).

Research suggests that localized factors in the immediate area of the device may contribute more substantially to early thrombotic risk (within the first two weeks after insertion) than systemic factors (Chen et al., 2021). In pediatric patients, repeated PICC insertions in the same arm have been associated with increased risk and accelerated progression of symptomatic thrombosis (Gnannt et al., 2018).

### **2.3 Risk Assessment Tools**

Various scoring systems have been studied to identify patients at elevated risk for catheter-associated thrombosis, primarily in patients receiving peripherally inserted central catheters. The Caprini Risk Assessment Model may have predictive value for PICC-related thrombosis, particularly in high-risk populations, though its moderate sensitivity and low specificity may result in overdiagnosis (Lin et al., 2021; Li et al., 2020; Feng et al., 2021).

The Michigan Risk Score was developed specifically to predict PICC-associated thrombosis and has been validated in hospitalized populations (Chopra et al., 2017; Kang et al., 2022). Emerging research indicates that machine learning approaches incorporating genetic data may enhance identification of high-risk patients (Liu et al., 2019).

Further validation studies are needed before these tools can be recommended for routine clinical application across all patient populations.

## 

## **Thrombosis Prevention Through Device Selection**

Device selection should integrate assessment of the patient's vascular anatomy, treatment requirements, anticipated dwell time, and individual preferences including laterality considerations.

### **3.1 General Principles of Device Selection**

Selecting the smallest diameter catheter with the fewest lumens capable of delivering the prescribed infusion therapy reduces thrombotic risk while maintaining clinical functionality (Liu et al., 2022; Schears et al., 2021; Gnannt et al., 2018; Baskin et al., 2019; Bahl et al., 2023).

### **3.2 Central Venous Access Device Considerations**

For nontunneled central venous catheters in adult intensive care patients, the subclavian insertion site carries lower thrombotic risk compared to jugular or femoral approaches. However, subclavian access should be avoided in patients with chronic kidney disease due to increased risk of central venous stenosis that could compromise future dialysis access. The femoral site is associated with the highest thrombotic risk among central venous insertion locations (Parienti et al., 2015; Saha et al., 2022; Chopra, 2022).

### **3.3 Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters**

PICCs have been associated with higher DVT rates than other central venous access devices, primarily due to reduced blood velocity in upper extremity vessels. This risk is particularly elevated in critically ill patients (Chopra et al., 2013; Kleidon et al., 2021; Schears et al., 2021).

However, meta-analytic data indicate that when optimal insertion techniques are employed and single-lumen, smaller diameter devices are selected, PICC-related DVT rates become comparable to other central venous access options (Schears et al., 2021).

A bundled approach to PICC insertion that incorporates systematic ultrasound vessel evaluation, site optimization, techniques that minimize vascular trauma, verified optimal tip placement, appropriate catheter-to-vein ratio (not exceeding 45%), and use of the smallest diameter and fewest lumens necessary has been shown to reduce thrombotic complications (Schears et al., 2021; Balsorano et al., 2020; Rabelo-Silva et al., 2022).

Evidence from a single-center randomized controlled trial suggests that tunneled PICCs may have lower thrombosis incidence and reduced maintenance costs compared to nontunneled PICCs, though additional research is warranted (Dai et al., 2020).

### **3.4 Implanted Vascular Access Ports in Oncology**

For patients receiving cancer treatment, implanted vascular access ports are associated with lower thrombotic risk compared to PICCs and may be preferred when long-term access is anticipated (Farge et al., 2019; Capozzi et al., 2021; Taxbro et al., 2019; Moss et al., 2021).

The optimal location for port placement (chest versus arm) should balance known risks with patient preference and treatment requirements. Meta-analytic data suggest that total complication rates, including thrombosis, do not differ significantly between arm-placed and chest-placed ports in general oncology populations (Li et al., 2019). However, retrospective data in breast cancer patients specifically have shown increased symptomatic UE-DVT with arm-placed ports compared to chest-placed devices (Tippit et al., 2018).

For adult cancer outpatients requiring home parenteral nutrition, prospective data indicate that symptomatic catheter-related thrombosis rates are similarly low across PICCs, tunneled-cuffed catheters, and implanted ports (Cotogni et al., 2021).

### **3.5 Pediatric Device Selection**

In children with cancer diagnoses, implanted ports are the preferred vascular access device for reducing VTE risk compared to tunneled and nontunneled central venous catheters (Hansen et al., 2021). Multicenter prospective data confirm that PICCs are associated with significantly higher catheter-related VTE risk than tunneled lines in pediatric patients (Jaffray et al., 2020).

### **3.6 Midline Catheters**

Utilization of midline catheters has expanded substantially, creating an urgent need for high-quality comparative research. Systematic review and meta-analysis including over 40,000 adult patients found that VTE prevalence with midline catheters was significantly higher than with PICCs (Lu et al., 2022). Pediatric data on midline-associated thrombotic risk remain limited.

### **3.7 Thromboresistant Catheter Technologies**

Catheter surface modifications and material innovations including hydrogel coatings, drug-eluting surfaces, and hydrophilic or hydrophobic characteristics represent an evolving area of research with potential for reducing thrombotic risk. However, confirmatory clinical trials with adequate sample sizes are needed before specific product recommendations can be made (Ngo & Grunlan, 2017; Slaughter et al., 2020; Moureau et al., 2022; Ullman, 2022; Bahl et al., 2021; Bunch, 2022; Winkler et al., 2021; Gavin et al., 2020).

### **3.8 Arterial Catheter Considerations**

Thrombotic risk with arterial catheters can be minimized through ultrasound-guided insertion, optimization of catheter entry angle and intraluminal length, secure stabilization, and frequent monitoring of distal circulatory status (Ying et al., 2022; Imbrìaco et al., 2022).

---

## 

## **Insertion Technique and Early Prevention**

### **4.1 Qualified Inserters and Vascular Visualization**

All vascular access devices should be inserted by clinicians with specific competency-based training who utilize real-time vascular visualization technology. Ultrasound guidance improves first-attempt success rates and reduces vascular trauma (Wang et al., 2020; Kleidon et al., 2021; Balsorano et al., 2020; Trezza et al., 2021).

### **4.2 Central Venous Catheter Tip Positioning**

Optimal tip position for central venous access devices inserted via upper body sites is the lower third of the superior vena cava or upper third of the right atrium at or near the cavoatrial junction for both adult and pediatric patients. For devices inserted via lower body sites, the catheter tip should be positioned in the inferior vena cava above the level of the diaphragm.

Electrocardiography-guided tip positioning for PICCs has been associated with reduced thrombotic complications compared to traditional positioning methods (Kleidon et al., 2021; Yin et al., 2020).

For umbilical venous catheters in neonates, proper tip positioning must be verified before use to prevent thrombotic complications including portal vein thrombosis (Bersani et al., 2021).

### **4.3 Catheter-to-Vessel Ratio**

The catheter-to-vessel ratio should be measured prior to insertion using ultrasound assessment. A ratio not exceeding 45% is recommended to maintain adequate blood flow around the catheter and reduce thrombotic risk (Li et al., 2021; Kleidon et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021; Balsorano et al., 2020; Rabelo-Silva et al., 2022; Fabiani et al., 2023).

### **4.4 Catheter Exchange Considerations**

PICC exchange over guidewire has been independently associated with approximately twofold increased thrombosis risk in retrospective analysis. This elevated risk may be influenced by the fact that patients requiring exchange were more likely to have multilumen devices (Chopra et al., 2018).

### **4.5 Post-Insertion Interventions**

Upper extremity exercise may reduce venous stasis and lower thrombotic risk. Handgrip exercise using an elastic ball performed three to six times daily for three weeks following PICC insertion was associated with decreased incidence of ultrasound-confirmed DVT in patients with cancer (Liu et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2020; Qian et al., 2021). Further research is needed to identify optimal post-insertion nursing interventions for thrombosis prevention.

### **4.6 Pharmacologic Thromboprophylaxis**

Universal prophylactic anticoagulation for all patients with central venous access has not been established as standard practice. Decisions regarding thromboprophylaxis should be individualized based on patient-specific risk factors (Schears et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021).

For patients with cancer requiring central venous access for treatment, VTE prophylaxis is recommended and has not been associated with increased major bleeding risk (Farge et al., 2019; Li et al., 2021; Kahale et al., 2018).

In pediatric populations, the role of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis remains unclear. However, evidence from specific pediatric subgroups suggests that prophylactic anticoagulation may decrease CAT risk without increasing bleeding complications, including in children with inflammatory bowel disease and following infant cardiac surgery (Diamond et al., 2018; Swartz et al., 2022; Pelland-Marcotte et al., 2020).

---

## 

## **Clinical Monitoring and Detection**

### **5.1 Recognition of Clinical Manifestations**

Clinicians must recognize that catheter-associated DVT frequently presents without overt signs or symptoms. When clinical manifestations do occur, they result from obstruction of venous return and may include pain in the affected extremity, shoulder, neck, or chest; unilateral edema; erythema; and visible engorgement of peripheral veins in the involved extremity (Li et al., 2021; Feng et al., 2021).

### **5.2 Extremity Measurement Protocol**

Baseline circumference of the extremity should be measured and documented at the time of PICC or midline catheter insertion, with the precise anatomical location noted to ensure measurement consistency. Circumference should be reassessed whenever edema or signs suggestive of DVT are observed.

In adult patients with PICCs, an increase in mid-arm circumference of 3 centimeters or greater has been associated with catheter-related DVT (Li et al., 2021; Feng et al., 2021; Maneval & Clemence, 2014).

### **5.3 Pulmonary Embolism**

Pulmonary embolism secondary to catheter-associated thrombosis is uncommon but has been reported in association with both central venous catheters and midline catheters (Chopra et al., 2013; Bahl et al., 2021; Houghton et al., 2021).

### **5.4 Post-Thrombotic Syndrome**

Clinicians should recognize post-thrombotic syndrome as a potential long-term complication of catheter-associated DVT. This chronic condition is characterized by persistent pain, swelling, and skin changes in the affected extremity and may significantly impact patient quality of life (Wang et al., 2020; Polen et al., 2015; Thiyagarajah et al., 2019).

---

## 

## **Diagnostic Confirmation and Treatment**

### **6.1 Diagnostic Criteria**

Catheter-associated DVT is confirmed using color-flow Doppler ultrasonography when at least two of the following findings are present: an echogenic mass within the venous structure under evaluation; noncompressibility of the vein; abnormal color Doppler flow pattern; or venous filling defect.

For evaluation of more proximal veins such as the brachiocephalic vein, which may be obscured by the clavicle or ribs on ultrasound, contrast venography may provide superior visualization (Li et al., 2021; Chopra et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2019; Jaffray et al., 2020; Moss et al., 2021).

### **6.2 Catheter Management in Confirmed Thrombosis**

The presence of catheter-associated DVT does not automatically mandate device removal. When the catheter remains correctly positioned, functional, and necessary for ongoing infusion therapy, it may be retained. The decision to remove a central venous access device should be individualized based on the patient's overall clinical status, symptom severity, imaging findings, and treatment requirements (Farge et al., 2019; Sharathkumar et al., 2020; Norris et al., 2019).

### **6.3 Anticoagulation Therapy**

Treatment of confirmed catheter-associated DVT includes anticoagulation for a minimum of three months following diagnosis. For patients with indwelling devices anticipated to remain for extended periods, anticoagulation should continue for the duration of catheter dwell time.

Patients with severe symptoms may benefit from unfractionated heparin infusion or catheter-directed thrombolysis, though these interventions require careful assessment of bleeding risk and patient stability (Li et al., 2021; Farge et al., 2019; Sebolt et al., 2022).

---

## 

## **Device Removal**

### **7.1 Timely Removal**

All vascular access devices should be removed promptly when no longer clinically indicated. Unnecessary prolongation of device dwell time increases cumulative thrombotic risk.

### **7.2 Implanted Port Considerations**

Following completion of chemotherapy, the decision to retain or remove an implanted port requires careful evaluation of the patient's risk profile, potential need for future vascular access, and patient preferences. Routine port removal at treatment completion is not universally recommended, but ongoing surveillance is warranted if the device is retained (Tippit et al., 2018).

---

## 

## **Special Populations**

### **8.1 Oncology Patients**

Patients with active malignancy represent a high-risk population for catheter-associated thrombosis. Risk is influenced by cancer type, tumor characteristics, active chemotherapy administration, and functional status. Evidence supports use of thromboprophylaxis during cancer treatment requiring central venous access. Implanted ports are generally preferred for long-term access needs. Device selection should incorporate assessment of treatment duration, infusion requirements, and patient preference.

### **8.2 Critically Ill Patients**

Critical illness elevates thrombotic risk across all vascular access types. PICCs in particular carry increased thrombotic risk in intensive care populations. When central venous access is required, subclavian insertion may offer lower thrombotic risk than internal jugular or femoral approaches in patients without chronic kidney disease.

### **8.3 Pediatric Patients**

Children require age-appropriate risk assessment and device selection. Implanted ports are preferred for pediatric oncology patients requiring long-term access. Repeated PICC insertions in the same extremity should be avoided when possible due to cumulative thrombotic risk. Routine thrombophilia testing is not recommended following catheter-associated DVT in children.

### **8.4 Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease**

Preservation of the venous system for potential future dialysis access is paramount. Subclavian catheterization should be avoided due to increased risk of central venous stenosis. Device selection should minimize central venous trauma while meeting immediate therapeutic needs.

---

## 

## **Key Recommendations**

Comprehensive risk assessment should precede vascular access device selection for all patients. Risk factors span patient-specific conditions, device characteristics, and insertion technique variables. Prevention strategies include selecting the smallest appropriate device, ensuring optimal tip positioning, maintaining catheter-to-vessel ratios below 45%, and considering thromboprophylaxis in high-risk populations.

Clinical monitoring should include baseline and serial extremity measurements for PICCs and midline catheters, with recognition that most catheter-associated thrombosis is asymptomatic. Diagnosis requires color-flow Doppler ultrasound demonstrating characteristic findings. Confirmed thrombosis is treated with anticoagulation for at least three months, with catheter retention appropriate when the device remains functional and necessary.

Devices should be removed promptly when no longer clinically indicated to minimize cumulative risk.

# **Clinical Guideline: Central Vascular Access Device Malposition**

## **Assessment, Prevention, and Management**

**Version:** 1.0  
 **Effective Date:** January 2026  
 **Review Date:** January 2028

---

## **1\. Purpose and Scope**

This guideline establishes evidence-based recommendations for clinicians responsible for assessing, preventing, and managing malposition of central vascular access devices (CVADs). The standard applies to all healthcare professionals involved in CVAD insertion, maintenance, and monitoring across acute care, ambulatory, and home infusion settings.

**Clinical Standard:** Clinicians must assess for CVAD malposition and employ appropriate resources and interventions when malposition is suspected or confirmed. Early recognition and prompt management are essential to prevent serious complications including vessel erosion, cardiac dysrhythmias, infiltration, and life-threatening events such as cardiac tamponade.

---

## **2\. Definitions and Classification**

### **2.1 Primary Malposition**

Primary malposition occurs during or immediately following the CVAD insertion procedure. The catheter tip becomes positioned in an anatomically aberrant location rather than the intended target (typically the lower third of the superior vena cava at the cavoatrial junction).

### **2.2 Secondary Malposition**

Secondary malposition, also referred to as tip migration, develops at any point during the catheter dwell time after initial correct placement has been confirmed. This phenomenon results from changes in patient condition, physiological pressures, or mechanical factors affecting catheter position.

---

## **3\. Anatomical Considerations and Malposition Sites**

Understanding normal vascular anatomy and acceptable CVAD tip locations is essential for recognizing aberrant catheter positioning. Clinicians must correlate expected anatomy with potential malposition sites in the thorax, abdomen, and neck.

### **3.1 Intravascular Malposition Sites**

**Upper Body Insertions:** Primary intravascular malposition from jugular, subclavian, or upper extremity insertion sites may result in catheter positioning within the aorta, lower right atrium, right ventricle, ipsilateral or contralateral brachiocephalic (innominate) veins, subclavian veins, internal jugular veins, azygous vein, internal mammary vein, and various smaller tributary vessels (Raptis et al., 2020; Wortley & Almerol, 2020; Struck et al., 2018).

**Femoral Insertions:** Lower extremity access may produce malposition in the lumbar veins, iliolumbar veins, and common iliac veins (Büttner et al., 2017).

### **3.2 Extravascular Malposition Sites**

When catheters migrate outside the vascular system, they may cause serious complications depending on location. Extravascular malposition includes catheter positioning within the mediastinum (causing infiltration or extravasation), thoracic duct (producing chylothorax), pleural space (resulting in hemothorax or pleural effusion), pericardium (leading to pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade, particularly concerning in infants), peritoneum (causing intra-abdominal bleeding and potential abdominal compartment syndrome), and adjacent structures through fistula formation including tracheal communication (Sertic et al., 2018; Blackwood et al., 2016; Zarkesh & Haghjoo, 2022). In neonates, malposition into the epidural space has also been documented (Chin et al., 2021).

---

## **4\. Etiology of Malposition**

### **4.1 Causes of Primary Malposition**

Multiple factors contribute to primary malposition during insertion. Inadequate catheter length selection or insufficient insertion depth frequently results in suboptimal tip positioning. Patient positioning changes from supine to upright during or after insertion alter the relationship between anatomical landmarks and actual tip location. Respiratory movement, particularly diaphragmatic excursion, affects catheter position, with mechanical ventilation creating additional variability. Upper extremity and shoulder positioning influence catheter trajectory, while body habitus factors including obesity and breast tissue affect measurement accuracy and insertion angles (Raptis et al., 2020; Hade et al., 2019).

Congenital venous abnormalities represent an important and often unrecognized cause of malposition. Persistent left superior vena cava and variations in inferior vena cava anatomy, azygous vein configuration, and pulmonary venous return may not be diagnosed until CVAD insertion is attempted. These anatomical variants can make achieving appropriate tip position challenging or impossible through standard techniques (Oye et al., 2020).

Acquired venous changes including thrombosis, stenosis, and malignant or benign lesions may prevent catheter advancement to the appropriate position. Prior trauma can also alter venous anatomy and create obstacles to optimal catheter placement (Raptis et al., 2020; Koyuncu et al., 2020).

### **4.2 Causes of Secondary Malposition**

Tip migration during dwell time results from several mechanisms. Sporadic changes in intrathoracic pressure from coughing, vomiting, or straining can displace the catheter tip. CVADs with tips originally positioned high in the superior vena cava are more susceptible to migration. Development of deep vein thrombosis may alter flow dynamics and push the catheter into aberrant positions. Congestive heart failure changes cardiac dimensions and vascular pressures, potentially affecting catheter position. Neck and arm movement, particularly in active patients, creates repetitive mechanical stress on the catheter. Positive pressure ventilation, vigorous exercise, and partial or complete dislodgement from the insertion site all contribute to secondary malposition (Wang et al., 2018; Hignell & Phelps, 2020).

---

## **5\. Prevention Strategies**

### **5.1 Insertion Site Selection**

The side of insertion influences malposition risk. Left-sided insertions carry higher malposition risk due to the longer course of the left brachiocephalic vein and the more diagonal pathway to the heart. Additionally, left-sided catheters are more prone to contact the contralateral wall of the superior vena cava, increasing the risk of vessel erosion (Dornbos et al., 2019).

### **5.2 Insertion Technique Optimization**

Bevel orientation during guidewire insertion may reduce malposition incidence. For internal jugular venous access, orienting the bevel medially facilitates guidewire advancement toward the appropriate target. For subclavian approaches, caudal bevel orientation promotes proper catheter trajectory (Dornbos et al., 2019; Craigie et al., 2018).

### **5.3 Real-Time Imaging During Insertion**

Ultrasound visualization during insertion reduces the risk of inadvertent arterial cannulation. Additionally, ultrasound can identify cephalad tip orientation in the jugular vein before removing the sterile field, allowing immediate correction. Multiple studies support routine ultrasound use for CVAD placement (De Cassai et al., 2021; Kozyak et al., 2022; Aurshina et al., 2019; Ablordeppey et al., 2022; Keyal et al., 2020).

Tip location technology enhances detection of primary malposition during insertion. Electrocardiogram-guided placement, intracavitary electrocardiography, and other navigation technologies provide real-time feedback on catheter position, allowing adjustments before procedure completion (Alexandrou et al., 2022; Chai et al., 2022).

### **5.4 Avoiding High-Risk Tip Positions**

Catheter tips positioned in the lower right atrium are associated with increased risk of infective endocarditis. This occurs due to mechanical abrasion of the tricuspid valve or cardiac wall by the catheter tip, creating an entry point for microorganisms into the bloodstream (Chen et al., 2020).

---

## **6\. Clinical Assessment and Recognition**

### **6.1 Signs and Symptoms of Malposition**

Assessment for malposition should occur before each CVAD infusion, as clinical findings are often the first indication of catheter migration. Clinicians should evaluate for absence of blood return from any catheter lumen (though this finding alone is not diagnostic); changes in blood color or pulsatility of the blood return; difficulty or inability to flush the catheter; arterial waveform patterns when connected to a pressure transducer; new atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias; changes in blood pressure or heart rate; shoulder, chest, or back pain developing during insertion or dwell time; edema in the neck or shoulder region; respiratory changes; patient complaints of hearing gurgling or flow sounds on the ipsilateral side; and paresthesia or neurological effects that may indicate retrograde infusion into intracranial venous sinuses (Chen et al., 2019; Mauri et al., 2018; Pereira et al., 2016).

### **6.2 Monitoring for Dislodgement**

CVAD dislodgement represents a common cause of secondary malposition. Clinicians should measure and document the external catheter length at each dressing change and compare this measurement to the length documented at insertion. Discrepancies indicate potential dislodgement and tip migration (Chen et al., 2018).

Dislodgement occurs through multiple mechanisms including arm movement, body habitus changes, patient manipulation of the catheter (sometimes termed Twiddler's syndrome), inadequate securement, and improper dressing or securement device removal.

**Critical Safety Point:** Never advance any external portion of a CVAD that has contacted skin back into the insertion site. No antiseptic agent or technique can render skin or the external catheter sterile. No evidence supports any safe time interval after insertion for such manipulation. Management of significant dislodgement typically requires catheter exchange over a guidewire or removal with insertion at a new site.

### **6.3 Pediatric Considerations**

Growth in infants and children with indwelling CVADs can produce suboptimal tip location over time. Clinicians should monitor growth parameters and correlate them with anticipated changes in catheter tip position. Planning for scheduled CVAD exchanges should account for growth-related tip migration (Sertic et al., 2018; Chin et al., 2021).

---

## **7\. Diagnostic Evaluation**

### **7.1 Imaging Modalities**

When malposition is suspected based on clinical assessment or catheter dysfunction, diagnostic imaging should be obtained. Available modalities include chest radiography (with or without contrast injection), fluoroscopy, echocardiography, computed tomography (CT) scanning, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Selection depends on clinical presentation, available resources, and specific diagnostic questions (Raptis et al., 2020; Cunningham et al., 2020).

Communication with radiology personnel should include relevant clinical information to enhance their ability to identify the problem. Organizations should establish protocols with radiology departments to ensure routine imaging studies include assessment of catheter tip location when CVADs are present, along with clear reporting pathways for malpositioned catheters discovered incidentally.

### **7.2 Limitations of Routine Radiography**

Routine chest radiographs at scheduled intervals may fail to detect tip migration due to the sporadic and unpredictable nature of catheter movement. Each healthcare facility should evaluate the utility of admission chest radiographs for patients with existing CVADs based on patient population and clinical context.

### **7.3 Confirming Arterial Versus Venous Placement**

If inadvertent arterial placement is suspected (suggested by stroke or neurological injury, hematoma, or hemothorax at insertion or during dwell), definitive confirmation requires pressure transducer waveform analysis, blood gas values from the catheter, or computed tomography angiography (CTA). Visual assessment of blood pulsatility and color are unreliable indicators, particularly in hypotensive patients or when sampling through lengthy catheters (Ge et al., 2015; Dornbos et al., 2019).

---

## **8\. Management Approaches**

### **8.1 General Principles**

Management decisions depend on the malposition location, ongoing infusion therapy requirements, and patient acuity. Consultation with the primary provider and interventional radiology should occur as indicated.

**Critical Action:** Withhold infusion through a malpositioned catheter until appropriate tip position has been established. If continued therapy is required, assess the prescribed regimen for peripheral compatibility and consider inserting a short peripheral intravenous catheter. When infusion therapy cannot be delivered peripherally, evaluate the risk of temporary discontinuation and consult with the ordering provider regarding alternative regimens while working to reestablish appropriate CVAD tip location (Gorski, 2023).

### **8.2 Noninvasive Repositioning Techniques**

Noninvasive or minimally invasive approaches are preferred as initial interventions. Bedside ultrasound can identify catheter malposition in the internal jugular vein and guide repositioning attempts (Spencer, 2017; Zaghloul et al., 2019; Song et al., 2018).

**High-Flow Flush Technique:** For catheters angling cephalad into the internal jugular vein, contralateral subclavian or brachiocephalic vein, or other tributary vessels, a repositioning protocol involves elevating the patient's head to 60° to 90° (high Fowler's position) and performing a forceful flush through the catheter. Instructing the patient to cough during flushing may alter intrathoracic pressures sufficiently to allow catheter movement. Repeat imaging should confirm tip location following any repositioning attempt (Spencer, 2017; Gautam et al., 2015; Mesa et al., 2021).

**Intracardiac Malposition:** When the catheter tip is positioned in the lower two thirds of the right atrium or the right ventricle, the catheter should be retracted. Retraction distance should be determined using electrocardiogram guidance or direct measurement from chest radiography (Gorski, 2023).

### **8.3 Invasive Repositioning Techniques**

When noninvasive methods fail, invasive techniques include catheter exchange over a guidewire and interventional radiology procedures performed under fluoroscopic guidance. For long-term CVADs, repositioning may require inserting a diagnostic catheter via the femoral vein under fluoroscopy and using snaring techniques to manipulate the malpositioned tip (Gautam et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2018).

### **8.4 Management of Arterial Placement**

**Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters:** For a PICC inadvertently placed in an artery, remove the catheter and apply direct manual pressure to the arterial puncture site until hemostasis is achieved. Notify the primary clinical team for ongoing observation (Gorski, 2023).

**Large-Bore Central Catheters:** For inadvertent arterial placement from axillo-subclavian or jugular insertion sites, simple removal with manual compression creates significant risk. Withdrawal of large catheters from accessed arteries (particularly the carotid) with site compression increases risk of brain ischemia from interrupted blood flow, hematoma formation, or embolization. Consultation with interventional radiology and vascular surgery is essential to develop an appropriate removal plan. Endovascular techniques or open surgical repair may be required. Delay in management increases thrombosis risk (Dornbos et al., 2019; Ge et al., 2015).

### **8.5 Neonatal Considerations**

Repositioning approaches in neonates differ from adult techniques. Noninvasive attempts include elevating the head of the bed for internal jugular malposition, positioning the infant on the opposite side with head elevated for brachiocephalic malposition, and gentle flushing or fluid infusion. Secondary intravascular malposition in neonates may respond to extremity repositioning including abduction, adduction, flexion, or extension of the affected limb (Zaghloul et al., 2019; Sharpe et al., 2022).

### **8.6 Special Circumstances**

**Cardiac Tamponade:** If tamponade is suspected, fluid aspiration from the CVAD before removal may be indicated. Immediate consultation with cardiology and critical care teams is essential (Gorski, 2023; Zarkesh & Haghjoo, 2022).

**Infiltration or Extravasation:** When extravascular catheter migration has caused infiltration or extravasation, removal must be coordinated with appropriate treatment for the specific medication involved based on established extravasation protocols (Wang et al., 2018; Spencer, 2017; Gautam et al., 2015).

---

## **9\. Power Injection Considerations**

Only CVADs specifically labeled for power injection should be used with contrast media injection devices. Power injection through malpositioned catheters has been reported to cause mediastinal extravasation, and the force of injection may itself cause catheter migration.

Before and after power injection, clinicians should assess for clinical signs and symptoms of malposition, verify catheter patency by manual flush, aspirate for blood return, and confirm correct tip location. When uncertainty exists regarding tip position or catheter patency, a scout scan or topogram should be performed before power injection (Wortley & Almerol, 2020; American College of Radiology, 2023).

---

## **10\. Quality and Safety Measures**

### **10.1 Documentation Requirements**

Complete documentation should include initial catheter length at insertion, tip location confirmation method and results, external catheter length measurements at each assessment, clinical findings suggesting malposition, diagnostic imaging results, repositioning attempts and outcomes, and consultation records.

### **10.2 Organizational Policy Development**

Healthcare organizations should establish policies addressing routine imaging requirements for patients with CVADs on admission; radiology department protocols for reporting incidentally discovered malposition; communication pathways between clinical staff and radiology; competency requirements for CVAD insertion and assessment; and equipment availability for tip location confirmation during insertion.

# **Clinical Guideline: Catheter-Associated Skin Injury**

## **Prevention, Assessment, and Management in Vascular Access Care**

---

## **1\. Introduction and Scope**

This clinical guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the prevention, identification, and management of catheter-associated skin injury (CASI) in patients with peripheral and central vascular access devices. The guidance applies across clinical settings including acute care, critical care, oncology, neonatology, and ambulatory infusion services.

Catheter-associated skin injury represents a significant clinical concern that increases patient discomfort, elevates healthcare costs, delays treatment, and may necessitate premature device removal and replacement. Implementing standardized prevention and management protocols is essential for optimizing patient outcomes and preserving vascular access.

---

## **2\. Definitions and Classification**

### **2.1 Catheter-Associated Skin Injury (CASI)**

Catheter-associated skin injury encompasses any abnormality of the skin occurring at a peripheral or central vascular access device site. This includes erythema, vesicles, bullae, erosion, or skin tears observed in the area of the device dressing or securement device that remains visible for 30 minutes or more following dressing or securement removal. CASI excludes skin conditions arising from unrelated sources such as eczema, autoimmune disorders, or systemic medication adverse events.

### **2.2 Medical Adhesive-Related Skin Injury (MARSI)**

Medical adhesive-related skin injury specifically refers to erythema or cutaneous abnormalities—including vesicles, bullae, erosion, or skin tears—that persist for 30 minutes or more after adhesive removal. This subcategory of CASI addresses injuries directly attributable to adhesive products used in vascular access management.

### **2.3 Classification of Skin Injury Types**

**Erythema** presents as red discoloration of the skin that may be painful or pruritic. Clinical recognition can be challenging in patients with darker skin pigmentation, requiring enhanced assessment techniques and attention to changes in skin texture or temperature.

**Allergic Contact Dermatitis (ACD)** represents a cell-mediated immune response occurring in the area of catheter or product contact. The affected area corresponds precisely to the zone of exposure. Clinical presentation includes erythema, vesicles, and pruritic dermatitis, with symptoms typically persisting up to one week.

**Irritant Contact Dermatitis (ICD)** involves non-immunological skin injury confined to the area of exposure. Presentation includes erythema, edema, and vesicles. Unlike allergic contact dermatitis, symptoms typically resolve quickly once the irritating exposure is eliminated.

**Tension Injury or Blister** results from separation of the epidermis from the dermis caused by tension or shear forces. Severe edema significantly potentiates the risk of this injury type.

**Skin Stripping** involves removal of one or more layers of the stratum corneum, commonly resulting from adhesive removal or excessive friction during site cleansing.

**Maceration** develops from prolonged moisture exposure and presents as pale, white, grey, or wrinkled skin. Macerated skin demonstrates increased permeability and heightened susceptibility to further injury.

**Skin Tear** describes separation of the epidermis from the dermis due to shear or friction forces and may be partial or full thickness in nature.

**Pressure Injury** involves damage to superficial and potentially deeper tissue structures resulting from prolonged pressure at the device site.

**Folliculitis** appears as small, inflamed, elevated pustules at hair follicles, frequently caused by trapped microorganisms or damage from shaving.

---

## **3\. Risk Assessment and Patient Factors**

### **3.1 Comprehensive Risk Evaluation**

Effective prevention of catheter-associated skin injury begins with thorough assessment of individual patient risk factors. Risk evaluation should inform decisions regarding device selection, insertion site, product choices, and monitoring frequency.

### **3.2 Patient Population Risk Factors**

Clinical evidence identifies several patient populations at elevated risk for CASI. Neonates and premature infants demonstrate particular vulnerability due to immature skin barrier function, with extremely low-birthweight and low-birthweight infants requiring specialized protocols (August et al., 2021; Mishra et al., 2021). Elderly patients face increased risk due to age-related changes in skin integrity and fragility.

Patients receiving oncology treatment, particularly those undergoing chemotherapy, experience heightened risk due to treatment-related skin toxicity and immunocompromise (Zhao et al., 2022; Tian et al., 2021). Additional high-risk populations include critically ill patients in intensive care settings, patients with compromised immune function, and those with pre-existing dermatological conditions (Frota et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2019).

Patients with peripheral edema or anasarca face elevated risk of tension injuries and dressing complications. Those with coagulopathies or receiving anticoagulation therapy may develop hematomas that promote subsequent skin injury. Patients with documented allergies or sensitivities to adhesives, antiseptics, or catheter materials require alternative product selection to prevent injury.

Nutritional status and hydration significantly influence skin integrity. Malnourished or dehydrated patients demonstrate compromised wound healing capacity and reduced skin resilience (McNichol et al., 2013; Broadhurst et al., 2017).

### **3.3 Device and Treatment-Related Factors**

The type of vascular access device, anticipated dwell time, and characteristics of prescribed infusates contribute to CASI risk. Patients requiring vesicant or irritant infusions, multiple infusion therapies, or extended treatment courses warrant enhanced monitoring protocols.

---

## **4\. Prevention Strategies**

### **4.1 Site Selection and Device Planning**

Prevention of catheter-associated skin injury begins with thoughtful device and site selection. Clinicians should avoid inserting vascular access devices into areas of pre-existing skin injury, scarring, or dermatological conditions (Rabelo et al., 2022; Pires-Júnior et al., 2021).

Utilization of vascular visualization technology during insertion reduces vascular trauma, minimizing bruising and hematoma formation that may promote subsequent skin injury (Ullman et al., 2019). For patients receiving chemotherapy with high skin toxicity risk, implanted ports may offer advantages over peripherally inserted devices (Yang et al., 2021).

Prior to device placement, clinicians should obtain a thorough patient history regarding previous CASI episodes and documented allergies to adhesives, antiseptics, or catheter materials. This information guides individualized product selection and preventive strategies (McNichol et al., 2013; Thayer, 2021; Ullman et al., 2019).

### **4.2 Hair Removal**

When hair removal at the insertion site is necessary, clipping or trimming is recommended rather than shaving. Shaving creates micro-abrasions that increase risk of folliculitis and infection (McNichol et al., 2013).

### **4.3 Skin Antisepsis**

The preferred skin antiseptic agent for vascular access procedures is alcohol-based chlorhexidine solution. Selection of antiseptic products should balance effective antimicrobial action with minimization of skin irritation and damage.

Clinical teams should carefully review product information, particularly for high-risk patients, as some antiseptic products are supplied in non-sterile form and may contain contaminants (Wiemken, 2019). When skin irritation is a concern, lower concentrations of antiseptic or aqueous solutions may be substituted. In cases of severe skin conditions, sterile saline may be used as an alternative.

Complete drying of antiseptic solution prior to dressing application is essential to reduce risk of maceration and skin irritation. Premature dressing application over wet antiseptic promotes moisture-related injury and may compromise adhesive integrity.

**Chlorhexidine Considerations:** True allergy to chlorhexidine is uncommon but has been documented, including reports of anaphylaxis (Devinck et al., 2021). Clinicians should note that patient histories may record skin irritation as an allergy, potentially limiting antiseptic options unnecessarily. Patch testing can help differentiate true allergy from irritant reactions (McNichol et al., 2013; Broadhurst et al., 2017).

**Neonatal Populations:** The neonatal population, particularly premature and low-birthweight infants, faces well-documented risk of skin injury from chlorhexidine use (Neri et al., 2017). Many neonatal intensive care units employ weight and gestational age criteria to guide antiseptic selection. Tincture of iodine is contraindicated in neonates due to absorption risk and potential thyroid toxicity.

Evidence remains insufficient to identify optimal skin antisepsis protocols for neonates, especially extremely low-birthweight infants. Current recommendations favor using the lowest effective chlorhexidine concentration (less than 1%), avoiding alcohol-based preparations in high-risk infants, and preferring aqueous chlorhexidine formulations (Mishra et al., 2021; Beekman & Steward, 2020; Bagheri et al., 2020; Sharma et al., 2021). Sodium hypochlorite has demonstrated minimal skin irritation in neonatal populations and represents an alternative option (Neri et al., 2017; Ciccia et al., 2018).

### **4.4 Skin Barrier Application**

Application of an alcohol-free skin barrier product enhances protection for the skin surrounding the vascular access device insertion site. Skin barriers provide a physical protective layer for the epidermis against irritants and reduce adhesive-related trauma during dressing changes. A variety of products are available with variable effectiveness; clinicians should follow manufacturer instructions and ensure compatibility with the antiseptic solution being used (Woo et al., 2019; Bodkhe et al., 2021; Ryder & Duley, 2017). Complete drying of the barrier product is required before proceeding with dressing application.

### **4.5 Dressing Selection and Application**

Vascular access device dressings are typically composed of polyurethane film with pressure-sensitive acrylate adhesive backing. Selection should consider breathability, stretch, conformity, adhesive characteristics, and compatibility with other products in use (Zhao et al., 2022; Thayer, 2021; McNichol et al., 2013).

**Application Technique:** Proper dressing application involves applying firm, gentle pressure while eliminating tension or stretch on the dressing material. Clinicians should limit or avoid substances that increase dressing adhesion such as tackifiers or bonding agents. Circumferential dressing coverage should be avoided as it may contribute to pressure injury (Rabelo et al., 2022; Thayer, 2021; McNichol et al., 2013).

**Chlorhexidine-Impregnated Dressings:** Chlorhexidine gluconate-containing dressings should be used to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections in patients greater than 2 months of age with short-term central vascular access devices, including oncology patients, unless contraindicated by sensitivity or allergy to chlorhexidine (Zhao et al., 2022; Rabelo et al., 2022; Hawes, 2021).

The risks and benefits of chlorhexidine-impregnated dressings require careful evaluation in patients with complicated skin disorders such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, graft-versus-host disease, burns, or anasarca, as well as in immunocompromised patients and infants (Canadian Vascular Access Association, 2019; Short, 2019; Jitrungruengnij et al., 2020).

**Alternative Dressing Options:** For challenging clinical situations, alternative dressing approaches may be warranted, including dressings that do not contain patient-specific allergens, gauze-only coverage for severe exfoliative dermatitis, silicone-based dressings, silver ion alginate antibacterial dressings to reduce folliculitis risk, hydrocolloid dressings for increased absorption, absorbent clear acrylic dressings, or hemostatic dressings for sites with bleeding (Zhao et al., 2022; Bernatchez & Bichel, 2023; Ye et al., 2019; Melhorn & Burkett, 2022).

When non-transparent dressings such as gauze are clinically indicated, expert consultation with wound care specialists, vascular access teams, or infectious disease specialists may inform optimal assessment frequency and dressing change intervals.

### **4.6 Dressing Change Intervals**

Dressings should be changed promptly when soiled, when integrity is compromised, or upon initial signs or symptoms of skin impairment, following manufacturer guidelines. The risks and benefits of extended dressing change intervals for central vascular access devices must be weighed against increased infection risk in certain populations (Short, 2019; de Campos Pereira Silveira et al., 2020).

### **4.7 Securement Methods**

Selection of dressing and securement methods should aim to reduce the frequency of dressing changes while incorporating patient characteristics, application area, anticipated dwell time, and prescribed therapy considerations (Thayer, 2021; McNichol et al., 2013; Hawes, 2021; Ryder & Duley, 2017).

**Liquid Adhesives:** Gum mastic liquid adhesive compatible with antiseptic and dressing products may be used when enhanced dressing adherence is required (Ullman et al., 2019; Ryder & Duley, 2017; DeVries et al., 2021). Cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive has demonstrated improved hemostasis, reducing localized bleeding at insertion sites and decreasing the need for early dressing changes (Gilardi et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2022). When liquid adhesives are used, application of skin barrier film prior to adhesive application and correct removal technique are essential to prevent skin injury from enhanced bonding (Thayer, 2021; McNichol et al., 2013; Bernatchez & Bichel, 2023).

**Securement Alternatives:** Various securement options may reduce CASI risk, including subcutaneous anchor securement systems, integrated securement dressings, silicone splinting for infants, and central line vests (Kleidon et al., 2020; Harris et al., 2022; McParlan et al., 2020).

**Medical Adhesive Tape:** When evaluating medical adhesive tape for additional securement or tubing anchoring, clinicians should consider skin stripping risk. Rubber-backed tapes are associated with increased skin stripping compared to other formulations (Frota et al., 2023). Ongoing research into temperature-sensitive and photo-thermal release adhesive prototypes shows promise for developing high-adhesion tapes with safer removal properties (Swanson et al., 2022; Lim et al., 2020).

### **4.8 Dressing and Securement Removal**

Proper removal technique is critical for preventing skin injury. The product should be kept horizontal to the skin surface during removal, as vertical pulling significantly increases peel force. The skin should be supported at the peel line throughout the removal process (Mishra et al., 2021; Thayer, 2021; McNichol et al., 2013; Hitchcock et al., 2021).

Medical adhesive remover should be used according to manufacturer instructions while maintaining aseptic non-touch technique. Additional precautions are warranted for patients at high risk for skin injury. Sterile saline may assist with removal in high-risk patients (Zhao et al., 2022; Mishra et al., 2021; Thayer, 2021; McNichol et al., 2013; Barton, 2020; Ryder & Duley, 2017; DeVries et al., 2021).

### **4.9 Product Integrity and Single-Patient Use**

The integrity of all products should be verified prior to use. Single-patient use should be maintained for all vascular access supplies (McNichol et al., 2013; Bernatchez & Bichel, 2023).

### **4.10 Supportive Measures**

Optimal skin health is supported by adequate hydration and nutrition. Patients with compromised nutritional status or dehydration may benefit from nutritional consultation and optimization as part of a comprehensive CASI prevention strategy (McNichol et al., 2013; Li et al., 2022; Broadhurst et al., 2017).

### **4.11 Education**

Staff education on vascular access site care, early recognition of skin injury, and prompt management of CASI is essential. Education should address proper antiseptic application, atraumatic dressing application, and safe removal techniques. Patients and caregivers, particularly parents of pediatric patients, should also receive education appropriate to their level of involvement in care (Zhao et al., 2022; Rabelo et al., 2022; Thayer, 2021; McNichol et al., 2013; Beekman & Steward, 2020; Broadhurst et al., 2017; Hawes, 2021).

### **4.12 Multidisciplinary Collaboration**

For high-risk patients, multidisciplinary collaboration involving dermatology and wound care specialists should be considered (Zhao et al., 2022; McNichol et al., 2013; Li et al., 2022; Ullman et al., 2019; Ye et al., 2019; DeVries et al., 2021).

### **4.13 Timely Device Removal**

Vascular access devices should be removed as soon as they are no longer clinically indicated to prevent skin injury associated with prolonged dwell time (Barton, 2020; Jacobs et al., 2022).

---

## **5\. Assessment and Monitoring**

### **5.1 Routine Assessment**

The vascular access device site, dressing, and securement status should be routinely assessed for signs and symptoms of skin injury. Assessment should include evaluation of skin texture, color, uniformity of appearance, and integrity using adequate lighting. Documented abnormalities should include specific findings such as vesicles, exudate, erythema, warmth, edema, or pressure-related injury (Zhao et al., 2022; McNichol et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2022; Pires-Júnior et al., 2021; Frota et al., 2023; Broadhurst et al., 2017; Saleh & Ibrahim, 2023).

### **5.2 Severity Assessment**

When skin injury is identified, severity assessment determines the impact on the vascular access device, the treatment regimen, and required management interventions (McNichol et al., 2013).

For premature infants exhibiting signs of chemical burn or irritation, immediate action is required to remove the potential source of irritation. Prompt treatment and specialist consultation with dermatology and surgery should be initiated as indicated (Neri et al., 2017).

### **5.3 Pain Assessment**

Pain related to skin injury should be assessed and treated as indicated. Management options include analgesics, anti-inflammatory agents, or cool compresses (Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022; Broadhurst et al., 2017; Canadian Vascular Access Association, 2019).

### **5.4 Pruritus Evaluation**

Pruritus associated with vascular access devices should be assessed. Treatment with antihistamines or steroids may be indicated. Clinicians should be aware that pruritus is common in certain populations, particularly patients with end-stage renal disease, which may mask CASI or other serious conditions (Broadhurst et al., 2017; Jacobs et al., 2022).

### **5.5 Differential Diagnosis**

Assessment should rule out other conditions that may mimic or accompany CASI, including infiltration, extravasation, thrombophlebitis, and skin conditions related to other body regions such as eczema, impetigo, cellulitis, erysipelas, or drug eruptions. Wound care or dermatology consultation should be obtained as indicated (Broadhurst et al., 2017).

Signs of localized or systemic infection, including fungal infection such as candidiasis presenting as whitish or raised red areas unresponsive to other treatment, should be assessed. Adhesives and resultant skin injury may promote bacterial overgrowth (Thayer, 2021; McNichol et al., 2013; Li et al., 2022; Barton, 2021; Pivkina et al., 2018; DeVries et al., 2021).

### **5.6 Product-Related Factors**

When abnormalities are noted, dressing, antiseptic, and securement-related factors should be ruled out. Common contributing factors include failure to allow products to fully dry, excessively frequent dressing changes, and improper removal technique (McNichol et al., 2013; Bernatchez & Bichel, 2023; Broadhurst et al., 2017).

### **5.7 Allergy and Sensitivity Monitoring**

Early monitoring and intervention are essential when allergy or sensitivity to a product is suspected. Alternative products for cleansing, dressing, and securement should be identified promptly (Thayer, 2021; Ullman et al., 2019; Devinck et al., 2021).

### **5.8 Assessment Tool Development**

Further validation of CASI assessment resources is needed to establish comprehensive, standardized skin assessment tools for vascular access care (Liu et al., 2022; Broadhurst et al., 2017).

---

## **6\. Management of Catheter-Associated Skin Injury**

### **6.1 General Principles**

Practice variation in CASI management remains significant, and further research is needed to establish evidence-based protocols. The following interventions are recommended based on current evidence (Zhao et al., 2022; McNichol et al., 2013; Li et al., 2022; Ullman et al., 2019; Bernatchez & Bichel, 2023; Milanesi et al., 2018; Barton, 2021; Broadhurst et al., 2017; Marcant et al., 2021).

### **6.2 Recommended Interventions**

**Exposure Elimination:** Subsequent exposure to products suspected of causing CASI should be avoided.

**Antiseptic Modification:** Consider changing to a different antiseptic product or reducing the concentration when antiseptic-related injury is suspected.

**Dressing Alternatives:** Dressing alternatives should be considered, balancing the need for adequate adhesion and securement against prevention of further skin damage during removal. The risks of insufficient adhesion leading to device loss must be weighed against skin protection needs.

**Securement Modifications:** Securement alternatives that reduce adhesive use should be considered. When using dressing systems with limited securement properties, additional attention to catheter securement and site protection is required, and monitoring frequency should be increased.

**Allergy Evaluation:** When new allergy is suspected, patch testing should be performed. Referral for formal allergy testing may be indicated (Marcant et al., 2021).

**Adhesive Remover:** If not already in use, medical adhesive remover should be incorporated into the dressing change protocol.

### **6.3 Skin Tear Management**

When skin tears with viable skin flaps are present, the skin flap edges should be realigned prior to dressing application (Broadhurst et al., 2017; Hitchcock et al., 2021).

Transparent semi-permeable membrane dressings, adhesive strips, and hydrocolloid dressings should be avoided for skin tear management due to risk of epidermal stripping if not removed properly.

When skin damage or drainage is not in the immediate area of the vascular access device insertion site, the wound and exudate should be isolated from the exit site. An absorbent dressing should be applied over the injury, with the transparent dressing then applied over the insertion site. Published protocols indicate that silicone mesh with transparent semi-permeable membrane dressing may be used when the dressing is applied over a healthy skin border (Hitchcock et al., 2021).

### **6.4 Corticosteroid Therapy**

When inflammation and pruritus at the site do not improve with initial interventions, short-term use of topical low-to-moderate potency corticosteroid may be considered. The corticosteroid should not be applied directly on the vascular access device insertion site, as these agents are non-sterile. Culture of the insertion site should be considered if infection is suspected (Broadhurst et al., 2017).

### **6.5 Escalation of Care**

If skin condition does not improve within 3 to 7 days or deteriorates despite the above measures, expert consultation should be obtained from wound care specialists or dermatology (McNichol et al., 2013; Broadhurst et al., 2017; Canadian Vascular Access Association, 2019).

### **6.6 Device Removal Consideration**

Vascular access device removal should be considered when skin injury is severe or unresponsive to treatment. The plan for ongoing vascular access needs should be reassessed prior to removal (Canadian Vascular Access Association, 2019).

### **6.7 Patient and Caregiver Education**

Patients and caregivers should understand the strategies in place to mitigate further skin injury and the specific products that should be avoided to prevent future recurrence (Thayer, 2021; Broadhurst et al., 2017).

## **7\. Quality Improvement**

Quality improvement measures should be employed to monitor and address the incidence of catheter-associated skin injury. Ongoing monitoring of current evidence should inform exploration of new prevention and management options (McNichol et al., 2013; DeVries et al., 2021).
