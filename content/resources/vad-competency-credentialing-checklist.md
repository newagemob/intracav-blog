# Vascular Access Device Competency and Credentialing Checklist

This checklist compiles the competency verification elements required for each level of vascular access practice — from peripheral IV placement through implanted port access. It is intended for use by vascular access educators, nursing leadership, and credentialing committees as a reference framework. Adapt to institutional protocols and regulatory requirements as needed.

---

## How to Use This Checklist

**Purpose:** This framework defines the minimum competency elements for each VAD privilege level. Use it to:
- Design or audit institutional credentialing programs
- Verify individual practitioner competencies during initial training and annual review
- Document training and supervised procedure completion for privileging files
- Benchmark your institutional credentialing program against AVAR and professional standards

**Scoring:** For proctored competency observations, use a pass/fail or 1–4 scale for each element. Minimum passing threshold should be defined by institutional policy (typically ≥85–90% on observed competency).

**Documentation:** Retain completed checklists in the practitioner's credentialing file. Annual competency re-verification is required for each privilege level.
