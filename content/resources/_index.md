# Vascular Access Clinical Resources

Free, evidence-based clinical resources designed for hospital educators, vascular access team (VAT) leaders, infection preventionists, and frontline clinicians. Every resource is grounded in current guidelines — INS 2021 Standards, CDC/MMWR recommendations, SHEA/IDSA practice guidance, and peer-reviewed literature — and is formatted for real-world clinical use.

These resources are free to use and share with attribution. They are designed to be adapted for institutional policy, staff education, competency programs, and quality improvement initiatives.
