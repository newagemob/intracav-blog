# CLABSI Prevention Framework: Complete Evidence-Based Reference for Clinical Teams

Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) is one of the most preventable and most costly healthcare-associated infections. The evidence that CLABSIs are preventable — not merely reducible — was established by the Keystone ICU project, in which 103 Michigan ICUs reduced median CLABSI rates to zero within 18 months using a structured bundle approach. This framework consolidates the evidence base for CLABSI prevention into a clinical reference spanning definitions, epidemiology, the complete insertion and maintenance bundles, advanced prevention strategies, and implementation science.

## Section 1: Definitions and Surveillance

### CLABSI vs CRBSI

**CLABSI (Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection):** A surveillance definition used by NHSN for public reporting, regulatory compliance, and benchmarking. CLABSI is defined as a primary bloodstream infection (no other identified source) in a patient who had a central line present at the time of blood culture collection or within 48 hours before.

**CRBSI (Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infection):** A clinical diagnosis requiring more rigorous microbiologic criteria — paired quantitative blood cultures (catheter hub vs peripheral vein) or differential time-to-positivity (DTP) data confirming the catheter as the source. CRBSI rates are consistently lower than CLABSI rates at the same facility because NHSN CLABSI criteria are more inclusive.

**Clinical implication:** CLABSI is what you report to regulatory agencies and use for benchmarking. CRBSI is what your clinicians diagnose and treat. Both matter; they measure different things.

### NHSN CLABSI Criteria (LCBI)

NHSN defines CLABSI as meeting one of three Laboratory Confirmed Bloodstream Infection (LCBI) criteria:

- **LCBI 1:** Recognized pathogen (e.g., *S. aureus*, gram-negative bacilli) cultured from ≥1 blood culture, and the organism is not related to an infection at another site
- **LCBI 2:** Common commensal (e.g., *S. epidermidis*, diphtheroids) cultured from ≥2 blood cultures drawn on separate occasions, patient has ≥1 sign/symptom (fever, chills, hypotension), and organism not related to infection at another site
- **LCBI 3:** Same as LCBI 2 but applies to patients ≤1 year with additional age-appropriate sign/symptom criteria

**Central line definition (NHSN):** An intravascular catheter that terminates at or close to the heart or in one of the great vessels — includes: PICC, CVC, tunneled CVC, implanted port (when accessed), hemodialysis catheter, umbilical catheters in neonates. Does NOT include: midline catheters, peripheral IVs.

### Surveillance Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Target |
|---|---|---|
| CLABSI rate | (Events / Central line-days) × 1,000 | <1.0; ideally 0 |
| SIR | Observed / Predicted CLABSIs | <1.0 |
| Central line utilization ratio | Central line-days / Patient-days | Unit-specific benchmarks |

---

## Section 2: Epidemiology and Pathogenesis

### Scope of the Problem

- **US incidence:** 30,000–41,000 CLABSIs per year (NHSN 2020 estimates)
- **Attributable mortality:** 12–25% of CLABSI patients die as a direct result of the infection
- **Cost per event:** $46,000–$68,000 (Pronovost 2011); adjusted for inflation, current estimates $55,000–$90,000
- **Regulatory status:** CLABSI is a Medicare non-reimbursable Hospital-Acquired Condition (HAC); hospitals bear full treatment cost

### Pathogenesis Routes

1. **Extraluminal route (most common for short-dwell CVCs):** Skin organisms at the insertion site migrate along the outer catheter surface to the tip. Primary prevention: skin antisepsis + sterile insertion + CHG dressings
2. **Intraluminal route (most common for long-dwell CVCs):** Contamination at the catheter hub or connector during manipulation; organisms track along the inner lumen to the tip. Primary prevention: scrub-the-hub + passive disinfection caps + minimizing access events
3. **Hematogenous seeding (uncommon):** Organisms from a remote infection site deposit on the catheter fibrin sheath or thrombus. Prevention: treat remote infections; remove catheters when CLABSI risk is high

### Common Pathogens

| Pathogen | Frequency | Route | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Coagulase-negative staphylococci | ~35% | Extraluminal, intraluminal | S. epidermidis most common; biofilm-forming |
| S. aureus (including MRSA) | ~20% | Extraluminal | High mortality; always treat aggressively |
| Candida species | ~10–15% | Intraluminal; hematogenous | Higher in PN patients; high mortality |
| Gram-negative bacilli (E. coli, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas) | ~20% | Intraluminal | Associated with gut translocation in ICU |

## Section 3: The CLABSI Insertion Bundle

The CLABSI insertion bundle contains 5 elements, all of which must be completed for each CVC/PICC insertion:

### Element 1: Hand Hygiene

**Requirement:** Perform WHO-compliant hand hygiene (alcohol hand rub or surgical hand scrub) immediately before donning sterile gloves. Hand hygiene after removing contaminated gloves before sterile gloving is essential.

**Evidence:** Hand hygiene reduces transient skin flora that is the most common source of insertion-site contamination.

### Element 2: Maximum Sterile Barrier Precautions (MSB)

**Requirement:**
- Inserter: sterile gown, sterile gloves, mask, surgical cap
- Patient: full-body sterile drape from head to feet
- All personnel in the room during insertion: mask and cap

**Evidence:** Mermel et al. (1991) landmark study: MSB reduced CRBSI rates 6-fold compared to "mini-drape" technique.

### Element 3: Chlorhexidine Gluconate (CHG) Skin Antisepsis

**Requirement:**
- Use 2% CHG in 70% isopropyl alcohol (CHG/IPA)
- Apply with back-and-forth scrubbing friction for ≥30 seconds
- Allow to **fully dry** before needle puncture (≥30 seconds on dry skin; up to 2 minutes on moist skin)

**Evidence:** Chaiyakunapruk (2002) meta-analysis: CHG reduces CRBSI risk by 49% vs povidone-iodine (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27–0.97).

**Do not blot, fan, or wave to hasten drying** — the drying process is part of the antimicrobial action.

### Element 4: Optimal Site Selection

**Priority for CLABSI prevention:**
1. Subclavian vein (lowest CLABSI rate, but highest pneumothorax risk)
2. Internal jugular (moderate CLABSI risk)
3. Femoral vein (highest CLABSI rate — avoid when possible)

**PICC vs non-tunneled CVC:** For patients who are not critically ill, PICC has lower CLABSI risk than IJ or femoral CVC and should be strongly considered as an alternative to bedside CVC insertion.

**Special populations:**
- ESRD/CKD patients: avoid subclavian (central venous stenosis) → use IJ
- Coagulopathic patients: IJ preferred (compressible site)
- Burn patients at insertion sites: consult specialized burn/surgery team

### Element 5: Daily Necessity Review

**Requirement:** Document daily assessment of whether each central line remains clinically necessary.

**Evidence:** Every unnecessary catheter-day represents cumulative CLABSI risk without clinical benefit. The Keystone bundle's daily-removal component was among the most impactful elements in Michigan ICU CLABSI reduction.

**Documentation:** Must be specific — "PICC still needed for IV vancomycin, expected course 14 days, Day 5" is meaningful. "Still needed" is not sufficient documentation.

---

## Section 4: The CLABSI Maintenance Bundle

The maintenance bundle protects the CVAD from intraluminal and hub-origin contamination during dwell.

### Element 1: Scrub the Hub

**Requirement:** Before every access of a needleless connector or catheter hub, scrub the access surface with 70% isopropyl alcohol or CHG/IPA for **15 seconds of friction**, followed by **15–30 seconds of drying time**.

**Evidence:** Studies demonstrate median observed hub scrub time of <7 seconds in clinical practice — far below the evidence-supported 15 seconds. Proper scrub time is the most common maintenance bundle failure point.

**Implementation tip:** Count aloud or use a timer. "Wipe once and insert" is not hub decontamination.

### Element 2: CHG-Impregnated Dressings

**Requirement:** Use CHG-impregnated disc (e.g., Biopatch, placed blue side toward skin) or CHG-impregnated transparent semipermeable dressing for all CVADs.

**Evidence:**
- Timsit et al. (2009, Lancet): CHG dressings reduced CRBSI by 60% vs standard transparent dressings (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.18–0.89) — a landmark RCT
- PROTECT trial (2012): Confirmed CRBSI reduction with CHG disc at CVC sites

**Replacement interval:** CHG dressings follow the standard dressing change schedule (every 7 days for intact transparent dressings; every 2 days for gauze; immediately if soiled, wet, or lifted at edges).

**Contraindication:** Avoid CHG dressings in neonates <7 days old or <26 weeks gestational age due to skin absorption and systemic toxicity risk.

### Element 3: Daily CHG Bathing

**Requirement:** Bathe ICU patients daily with 2% CHG cloths (or equivalent).

**Evidence:**
- Climo et al. (2013, NEJM): Daily CHG bathing reduced CLABSI by 28% (relative risk 0.72) and MRSA acquisition by 37% in a multicenter RCT
- Bleasdale et al. (2007): Additional ICU study confirming 32% CLABSI reduction with daily CHG bathing

**Application:** CHG bathing cloths cover all body surfaces except face, eyes, and mucous membranes. Do not rinse off after application — CHG provides residual antimicrobial activity that is eliminated by rinsing.

### Element 4: Needleless Connector Management

**Requirement:**
- Use split-septum connectors (preferred) — lower CLABSI association than mechanical valve connectors
- Scrub before every access (see Element 1)
- Change connectors every 96 hours with administration set changes; change immediately if visibly contaminated or compromised
- Avoid positive-pressure mechanical valve connectors (PPMCs) — associated with CLABSI outbreaks in multiple investigations

**Passive disinfection caps:** Alcohol-impregnated passive disinfection caps (Curos, SwabCap) placed on connector between access events provide ongoing 70% IPA disinfection.  Category IB recommendation for reducing intraluminal CLABSI risk.

### Element 5: Administration Set Change Intervals

| Infusate | Change Interval |
|---|---|
| Continuous infusions, no lipid/blood | Every 96 hours |
| Intermittent infusions | Per institutional policy (typically 24h) |
| Lipid-containing PN (3-in-1 TNA) | Every 24 hours |
| Lipid emulsion alone | Every 12 hours |
| Blood and blood products | Within 4 hours per unit |
| Propofol | Every 12 hours or per manufacturer |

## Section 5: Advanced Prevention Strategies

### Antimicrobial Catheters

Two main types, used when standard bundle is not achieving target CLABSI rates:

**CHG-silver sulfadiazine (CHG/SS) catheters:** External surface impregnation; effective primarily against extraluminal organisms; generally limited to first 7–14 days.

**Minocycline-rifampin (M/R) catheters:** Internal and external surface impregnation; Darouiche (1999, NEJM) RCT demonstrated reduction from 3.4 to 0.3 CLABSI per 1,000 catheter-days (p<0.001). Superior to CHG/SS in head-to-head comparison.

**When to use antimicrobial catheters (CDC category IB recommendation):** Patients expected to have CVC for >5 days in settings where bundle-compliant CLABSI rate remains >2 per 1,000 catheter-days despite adherence to standard bundle.

### Antimicrobial Lock Therapy (ALT)

ALT instills antimicrobial or antiseptic solutions into the catheter lumen to dwell between access events. Strategies:

- **Ethanol 70% lock:** Broad-spectrum, no resistance risk, effective against biofilm; used for long-term catheter salvage and prevention
- **Taurolidine-citrate:** Approved in Europe; antimicrobial and anti-biofilm; strong evidence for hemodialysis catheter CLABSI prevention
- **Antibiotic locks (vancomycin, gentamicin-citrate):** IDSA/CDC caution against routine use due to resistance promotion; appropriate in selected high-risk or recurrent CLABSI cases
- **Citrate 4%:** Anticoagulant with some antimicrobial properties; alternative to heparin lock in hemodialysis catheters

## Section 6: CLABSI Zero Implementation Framework

The path from "reduced CLABSI" to "zero CLABSI" requires more than protocol implementation — it requires a culture shift in which every CLABSI is treated as a preventable harm, investigated individually, and used to drive improvement.

### Infrastructure Requirements

1. **Real-time surveillance:** Infection control nurses reviewing blood culture results daily; CLABSI events identified within 24–48 hours of culture positivity
2. **Individual case review:** Every CLABSI is reviewed for root-cause analysis — what went wrong, when, and what can prevent the next one
3. **Bundle compliance tracking:** Real-time (not retrospective) tracking of insertion and maintenance bundle completion; deviations are investigated
4. **Empowerment to stop unsafe procedures:** Any team member can call a "time-out" if insertion is proceeding without proper sterile precautions — leadership must establish this culture

### The Daily CLABSI Prevention Huddle

In high-performing ICUs, a brief (10-minute) daily safety huddle addresses:
- Are there any patients with fever or suspected CLABSI today?
- Which catheters are no longer needed and should be removed today?
- Were any insertions yesterday not fully bundle-compliant?

This daily habit keeps CLABSI prevention active rather than episodic.
