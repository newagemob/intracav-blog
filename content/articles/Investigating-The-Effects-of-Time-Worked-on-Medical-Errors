# Investigating The effects of Time Worked on Medical Errors

# Article Summary

Long working hours in healthcare have been linked to an increase in medical errors, affecting both professionals and patient safety. Research consistently demonstrates that extended working hours contribute to fatigue, burnout, and impaired cognitive functioning among healthcare workers, which in turn leads to a higher risk of medical errors (an issue recognized as a leading cause of mortality in the United States), responsible for over 250,000 deaths annually.[\[1\]](https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-019-3993-5)[\[2\]](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/work-hour-training-for-nurses/longhours/mod3/10.html)[\[3\]](https://scribemedics.org/patient-safety/) Studies indicate that healthcare workers, particularly nurses, who exceed recommended work limits are nearly twice as likely to make errors, underscoring the urgent need for reform in work practices and staffing policies.[\[4\]](https://scribemedics.org/medical-errors/)[\[5\]](https://patientsafety.pa.gov/ADVISORIES/Pages/201406_53.aspx)

Factors contributing to long working hours in the healthcare sector include chronic staffing shortages, inadequate funding, rising cost of living, and organizational cultures that normalize excessive shifts. These conditions pressure workers to extend their hours, often resulting in mandatory overtime, which exacerbates fatigue and increases the likelihood of errors.[\[6\]](https://www.amnhealthcare.com/amn-insights/news/rise-in-healthcare-overtime/)[\[7\]](https://tcpsoftware.com/blog/effectively-manage-healthcare-center-overtime/) The detrimental effects of shift work, particularly night shifts that disrupt circadian rhythms, further complicate the situation, as they are linked to increased occupational fatigue and health issues.[\[8\]](https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-021-07231-4)[\[9\]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/global-womens-health/articles/10.3389/fgwh.2024.1455422/full) The pervasive culture of overwork within many healthcare settings not only jeopardizes employee wellbeing but also compromises patient care outcomes, as exhausted healthcare workers struggle to maintain their performance levels.[\[10\]](https://www.dovepress.com/do-organizational-values-and-leadership-impact-staff-engagement-wellbe-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-JHL)

Efforts to mitigate these issues have included recommendations from various health organizations to limit working hours and promote better working conditions. For instance, the Institute of Medicine has advocated for restricting nurses' shifts to a maximum of 12 hours to enhance both patient safety and worker health.[\[11\]](https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-024-12003-x) Despite such guidelines, many healthcare environments continue to face challenges related to excessive workloads, insufficient staffing, and the normalization of long hours, which hinder the implementation of effective change.[\[12\]](https://www.ghx.com/the-healthcare-hub/healthcare-burnout/)

Controversies surrounding this issue primarily revolve around the balance between operational demands and the health of workers, as well as the ethical implications of risking patient safety through worker exhaustion. The discussion emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach that includes organizational change, improved communication, flexible scheduling, and enhanced mental health support to address the root causes of long working hours and their associated medical errors.[\[13\]](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/13/6/e071203)[\[14\]](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/burnout-among-healthcare-professionals-silent-williams-ph-d-cbcp)

# Background

The issue of long working hours in healthcare has been increasingly scrutinized due to its profound impact on both healthcare workers and patient safety. Numerous studies have highlighted a significant correlation between extended working hours and adverse outcomes in both employee health and patient care[\[1\]](https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-019-3993-5)[\[2\]](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/work-hour-training-for-nurses/longhours/mod3/10.html). A systematic

literature review published in 2019 identified various working time arrangements, including night shifts, rotating shifts, and long hours, as detrimental factors that influence sleep disturbances, fatigue, burnout, leading to medical errors[\[1\]](https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-019-3993-5).

Healthcare workers often face excessive fatigue from accumulated hours worked in a week, rather than the occasional long shift. This chronic fatigue has been linked to a rise in medical errors, which are now estimated to be a leading cause of mortality in the United States, responsible for over 250,000 deaths annually[\[3\]](https://scribemedics.org/patient-safety/)[\[4\]](https://scribemedics.org/medical-errors/). The types of medical errors resulting from healthcare worker fatigue include diagnostic errors, poor communication, and medication mistakes, all of which can have severe consequences for the patient’s safety[\[3\]](https://scribemedics.org/patient-safety/)[\[4\]](https://scribemedics.org/medical-errors/)[\[5\]](https://patientsafety.pa.gov/ADVISORIES/Pages/201406_53.aspx).

Efforts to mitigate these issues have included recommendations from organizations such as the Institute of Medicine, which suggested limiting nurses' work hours to a maximum of 60 hours per week and 12 hours per shift to safeguard both patient care and the wellbeing of healthcare professionals[\[2\]](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/work-hour-training-for-nurses/longhours/mod3/10.html). However, despite these guidelines, the ongoing trend of overtime work and inadequate staffing continues to put a strain on healthcare workers, thereby compromising their ability to deliver high quality patient care[\[6\]](https://www.amnhealthcare.com/amn-insights/news/rise-in-healthcare-overtime/)[\[7\]](https://tcpsoftware.com/blog/effectively-manage-healthcare-center-overtime/).

# Factors Contributing to Long Working Hours

Long working hours and shift work are prevalent in various sectors, particularly in health care, where they pose significant risk factors. These conditions often come from persistent staffing shortages, which have been exacerbated by inadequate pay rates and staffing that fails to consider local demographic changes, such as population aging[\[8\]](https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-021-07231-4). As a result, health care workers, especially nurses, face increased pressure to extend their working hours, often through mandatory overtime or cultural expectations from employers to fill staffing shortages[\[8\]](https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-021-07231-4).

## Shift Work and Extended Hours

The nature of shift work, particularly night shifts, disrupts circadian rhythms, leading to potential health issues and cognitive disruptions. Studies indicate that shifts longer than 12 hours significantly elevate the risk of cognitive fatigue, leading to hazards[\[8\]](https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-021-07231-4)[\[9\]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/global-womens-health/articles/10.3389/fgwh.2024.1455422/full). For instance, nurses working overtime or extended shifts are at a significantly higher risk of making medical errors and poor communication; those working more than 40 hours per week are nearly twice as likely to commit such errors[\[8\]](https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-021-07231-4). Furthermore, research suggests that longer shifts, particularly those lasting 12.5 hours or more, correlate with increased error rates, with a dose response relationship observed among various shift durations[\[9\]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/global-womens-health/articles/10.3389/fgwh.2024.1455422/full).

## Organizational Culture and Work Expectations

The organizational culture within health care settings also plays a crucial role in shaping work patterns. A culture that fosters unrealistic expectations for staffing and work hours contributes to the normalization of extended shifts and overtime[\[10\]](https://www.dovepress.com/do-organizational-values-and-leadership-impact-staff-engagement-wellbe-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-JHL)[\[11\]](https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-024-12003-x). In many health care environments, nurses in specialized units are frequently expected to work extra shifts beyond their regular schedules, leading to a cycle of overwork and burnout[\[8\]](https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-021-07231-4). This culture not only undermines employee wellbeing but also negatively impacts patient care outcomes.

## Psychological Effects

The psychological impact of long working hours includes heightened stress and emotional exhaustion. Burnout, characterized by feelings of cynicism, detachment, and decreased personal accomplishment, is a common outcome of prolonged work related stress, particularly among healthcare professionals who operate in resource constrained and high stress environments[\[12\]](https://www.ghx.com/the-healthcare-hub/healthcare-burnout/)[\[13\]](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/13/6/e071203). Research shows that factors such as excessive paperwork and poor work life balance contribute significantly to these feelings of burnout, with healthcare workers experiencing a direct correlation between workload and emotional strain[\[12\]](https://www.ghx.com/the-healthcare-hub/healthcare-burnout/)[\[14\]](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/burnout-among-healthcare-professionals-silent-williams-ph-d-cbcp). The extended exposure to emotional demand from patients and the nature of healthcare work itself may also contribute to accelerated cognitive fatigue. This stress not only diminishes the effectiveness of the individual worker but can also impair team cohesion, reducing overall workplace morale and empathy among staff members and patients[\[9\]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/global-womens-health/articles/10.3389/fgwh.2024.1455422/full).

Moreover, long working hours may exacerbate preexisting psychological conditions. Chronic health issues, such as mood disorders, executive dysfunction, and anxiety, can be aggravated by the stress of nonstandard work schedules, leading to a cycle of fatigue and diminished cognitive functioning that further complicates job performance[\[9\]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/global-womens-health/articles/10.3389/fgwh.2024.1455422/full)[\[8\]](https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-021-07231-4).

## Physical Health Consequences

Physically, excessive working hours are linked to a range of serious health issues, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other chronic conditions. Extended shifts that exceed 12 hours significantly increase the risk of occupational fatigue, which can lead to various fatigue related hazards such as accidents and injuries both on and off the job[\[9\]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/global-womens-health/articles/10.3389/fgwh.2024.1455422/full)[\[8\]](https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-021-07231-4). In fact, working more than 40 hours a week is associated

with a higher incidence of health complications, including sleep disturbances and metabolic disorders[\[9\]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/global-womens-health/articles/10.3389/fgwh.2024.1455422/full)[\[15\]](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/16/12/2102).

Furthermore, the disruption of circadian rhythms associated with shift work, especially night shifts, can lead to unhealthy lifestyle habits such as reduced physical activity and poor dietary choices, further increasing the risk of chronic health problems[\[8\]](https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-021-07231-4)[\[16\]](https://ojin.nursingworld.org/table-of-contents/volume-23-2018/number-3-september-2018/articles-on-previously-published-topics/organizational-role-and-perception-safety-culture/). For instance, research indicates that night shift workers with Type 2 diabetes struggle more with blood glucose management compared to their dayshift counterparts, illustrating how prolonged and irregular work hours can adversely affect health outcomes[\[9\]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/global-womens-health/articles/10.3389/fgwh.2024.1455422/full).

# Relationship Between Long Working Hours and Medical Errors

A significant body of research indicates a strong correlation between long working hours and the incidence of medical errors among healthcare professionals. Long shifts, particularly those exceeding 24 hours, have been shown to negatively impact both the physical health of workers and patient safety outcomes. In a longitudinal study involving over 2,700 doctors, it was found that during months with extended work shifts, these professionals reported less sleep, increased fatigue, and a higher frequency of medical errors, with some leading to adverse patient outcomes[\[1\]](https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-019-3993-5).

## Epidemiological Evidence

Epidemiological studies consistently show the risks associated with prolonged working hours, especially in critical fields like healthcare. Research shows that extended work hours contribute to occupational fatigue, which is linked to a heightened risk of errors, disregard for proper procedures, and safety incidents. For example, medical interns adhering to traditional extended shifts exhibited a significant increase in serious medical errors—35.9% more than those in a reduced hour schedule—while their average sleep decreased by 5.8 hours per week[\[9\]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/global-womens-health/articles/10.3389/fgwh.2024.1455422/full). This pattern of diminished performance correlates with an increased likelihood of medication errors and diagnostic inaccuracies which ultimately negatively effects patient outcome[\[9\]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/global-womens-health/articles/10.3389/fgwh.2024.1455422/full)[\[2\]](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/work-hour-training-for-nurses/longhours/mod3/10.html).

## Specific Findings on Nursing

Nursing staff are particularly susceptible to the detrimental effects of long working hours. A 2004 Institute of Medicine report recommended limiting nurses' working hours to no more than 60 in a week and no more than 12 in a single day to enhance patient safety[\[2\]](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/work-hour-training-for-nurses/longhours/mod3/10.html). Additionally, studies have demonstrated that working over 40 hours weekly correlates with adverse outcomes for both patients and nurses[\[2\]](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/work-hour-training-for-nurses/longhours/mod3/10.html). While new hospital guidelines aimed to curb excessive hours did not lead to significant changes in the number of reported adverse events, they did increase the use of fatigue countermeasures, underscoring the importance of fatigue management in the healthcare setting[\[17\]](https://www.aha.org/case-studies/2015-09-14-waking-safety-nurse-work-hours-and-patient-safety). This may be due to nurses not reporting work hours in secondary work institutions outside of their full time employment.

## Decision Fatigue and Performance

The phenomenon of decision fatigue also plays a critical role in the relationship between long work hours and medical errors. As healthcare professionals engage in prolonged decision making, their cognitive resources and bandwidth become depleted, impairing their ability to make sound judgments[\[18\]](https://bmcnurs.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12912-024-02163-w). This results in a decline in decision quality, which can have serious negative outcomes for patient care. Research suggests that interventions such as short breaks and mindfulness training can alleviate decision fatigue, thereby improving decision making abilities and potentially reducing errors[\[18\]](https://bmcnurs.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12912-024-02163-w). There are many other factors, outside of long hours that influence cognitive performance. Stress levels can also take a toll on the clinician’s retention and process of information required for critical thinking. Hard and soft stressors start to accumulate over time during the working hours, not including residual effects of stressors from outside the work environment ie family conflicts, health issues, overdue bills, etc. Hard stressors at work may be physically and verbally assaulted by patients or colleagues while soft stressors may be inability to find the right policies or difficulty finding the right equipment. Although we label some of these stressors as “soft”, with enough volume it may greatly effect the clinician’s cognitive processing.

# Solutions and Mitigation Strategies

Efforts to address the root causes of excessive working hours and medical errors in healthcare settings necessitate a multifaceted approach that includes organizational change, effective communication, and targeted interventions aimed at improving worker wellbeing. Mitigating soft stressors like policy writing and distribution may be reduced with emerging AI software tools. For example; as cognitive function decreases for the clinician toward the end of the shift, AI can supplement some of the cognitive load and process documents such as policies and procedures so the clinician can reserve their cognitive bandwidth for critical thinking and decision making.

## Organizational Change

To create a more proactive environment in healthcare, organizations must prioritize systemic changes rather than solely relying on individual level interventions. Research indicates that workplace wellness programs that focus on organizational strategies are more effective in promoting long term employee wellbeing than reactive measures targeting individual health behaviors[\[13\]](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/13/6/e071203). Implementing comprehensive organizational changes can mitigate occupational stress and improve overall safety and quality of care[\[19\]](https://www.ahcstaff.com/4-actions-to-reduce-medical-errors-in-u-s-hospitals/). Consistency in organizational expectations may also reduce clinician stress. Poor policy management can create confusion among clinicians, especially when outdated policies are mistakenly followed. When clinicians are reprimanded for outcomes based on obsolete guidelines, it undermines their trust in the organization. As a result, they may begin to rely more on personal experience or peer practices rather than official protocols.

## Enhanced Communication

Transparent and open communication is vital in managing healthcare professionals, especially those engaged in shift work. Regular team meetings can facilitate the exchange of concerns and experiences among staff while providing management an opportunity to relay important updates. Establishing an open door policy encourages employees to voice their suggestions and concerns without fear of repercussion, fostering an environment of trust and transparency[\[20\]](https://hospitalcareers.com/blog/shift-work-in-healthcare/). Feedback mechanisms, such as suggestion boxes or employee surveys, can further identify specific areas for improvement in the workplace.

## Flexible Scheduling and Work Life Balance

Implementing flexible scheduling practices can significantly alleviate the stresses associated with shift work. Employers should consider employee preferences when assigning shifts and strive for consistency and fairness in scheduling. By accommodating the diverse needs of their staff, organizations can help maintain healthier work life balances, thus reducing stress and enhancing job satisfaction[\[20\]](https://hospitalcareers.com/blog/shift-work-in-healthcare/). Strategies such as encouraging time off and providing resources for family care also contribute to employee wellbeing and productivity. The balance of accommodating employee schedule preference and institutional needs is very complex and takes a lot of time to strategically plan. AI tools can help reduce that cognitive burden and find solutions or flag scheduling issues more efficiently and accurately.

## Sustainable Resources and Support

Establishing accessible mental health resources is essential in supporting healthcare workers. Systemic approaches should prioritize adequate safeguards for both mental and physical health, along with sustainable compensation practices. Organizations that ensure comprehensive support systems can better address the underlying issues contributing to excessive working hours and the prevalence of medical errors[\[21\]](https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/physician-health/work-overload-triples-risk-burnout-health-care). By prioritizing these strategies, healthcare organizations can foster an environment that not only enhances employee satisfaction but also ultimately leads to improved patient care and safety. Employee benefits are often difficult to navigate, let alone understand. AI large language models can be used to simply the process and access to information on their employment benefits.

# Effective Management Strategies

To mitigate the issues associated with excessive working hours and medical errors, effective management strategies must be implemented within healthcare organizations. These strategies not only aim to improve employee satisfaction but also enhance the quality of patient care.

## Organizational Policies

Reorganizing work processes is essential. This includes selecting staff according to demand, allocating responsibilities based on existing resources, and developing policies that foster both quality work and the wellbeing of healthcare workers (HCWs) [\[22\]](https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-024-02130-9). Additionally, recognizing early signs of burnout and modifying stress factors can significantly improve the mental and physical health of employees, ultimately benefiting patient centered care[\[22\]](https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-024-02130-9). Sentimental analysis of system wide AI chatbot may predict large burnout and mass employee exit trends before loss of employees.

## Reporting and Communication Systems

Establishing robust reporting systems encourages error and near miss reporting without fear of retribution. Transparent reporting allows for the recognition and analysis of error patterns, which can guide targeted interventions to improve quality and eliminate inefficiencies[\[4\]](https://scribemedics.org/medical-errors/). Furthermore, promoting interdisciplinary collaboration enhances teamwork and communication among health professionals, reducing the likelihood of errors caused by miscommunication[\[4\]](https://scribemedics.org/medical-errors/). Reporting incidents is a very cumbersome and time consuming task. Current systems are inefficient in capturing mid to low level incidents and even critical incidents are underreported. Sentimental feedback and analysis can also be efficiently processed and managed using AI. Using AI software to reduce the cumbersome process of current reporting may increase compliance with issues within the organization to address gaps and resolve them significantly faster.

## Employee Well Being Initiatives

Employers can promote healthy lifestyles among healthcare workers by offering healthy meal options, encouraging physical activity, and ensuring opportunities for adequate rest[\[20\]](https://hospitalcareers.com/blog/shift-work-in-healthcare/). Understanding the link between employee satisfaction and patient satisfaction is also critical; happier employees are often more engaged and effective in their roles[\[24\]](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/9-ways-to-fight-burnout-in-overworked-medical-staff).

## Technological Support

Leveraging technology can improve operational efficiency. Utilizing electronic systems to disseminate knowledge across departments ensures that HCWs have immediate access to updated clinical resources and guidelines, thus reducing inconsistencies in patient care[\[23\]](https://c8health.com/a/blog/vital-approaches-for-medical-error-reduction-and-prevention). Additionally, technology should not add to the administrative burden but should be integrated seamlessly into workflows[\[24\]](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/9-ways-to-fight-burnout-in-overworked-medical-staff). Current AI tools like Qpolicy can be implemented to simplify access and processing of institutional policies and procedures for both clinicians and administrators. This may significantly reduce the “soft” stressors at all levels while effectively improving adherence to updated practice.

By implementing these management strategies, healthcare organizations can create a supportive work environment that addresses the root causes of excessive working hours and medical errors, ultimately leading to better outcomes for both employees and patients.
