# Going Home with a Midline Catheter: Your Care Guide

A midline catheter is a medium-length IV catheter — longer than a standard peripheral IV but shorter than a PICC line. It sits in a large vein in your upper arm and is used when you need IV therapy lasting one to four weeks. Because the tip does not extend all the way into the chest, midlines have some differences from PICCs in how they are cared for and what they can be used for.

This guide covers everything you need to know about managing your midline at home.

## Understanding Your Midline

Your midline was inserted into a vein in your upper arm, typically using ultrasound guidance. The catheter is 8–20 cm long, and the tip sits within the upper arm or axillary vein region — not in the large central vein near the heart. This is what distinguishes it from a PICC.

**What your midline can and cannot do:**

- ✓ Deliver most standard IV antibiotics, antifungals, and fluids
- ✓ Deliver medications considered compatible with peripheral veins
- ✗ Cannot safely deliver highly irritating or concentrated solutions (certain chemotherapy agents, TPN/IV nutrition, concentrated potassium, vasopressors) — these require a central line
- ✗ Blood draws from a midline are generally not performed (unlike PICCs), as they can damage the device and reduce its lifespan

If your care team needs to draw blood while you have a midline, a separate arm stick is typically used.

**Write down and keep handy:**
- Which arm: Left / Right
- Insertion date: _____________
- Expected removal date: _____________
- Flush schedule: _____________

## Flushing Your Midline

Flushing keeps the catheter clear of blood and medication residue. Your specific flush schedule and solution will be provided by your care team.

### Typical flushing approach

Most midline catheters are flushed with **normal saline only** — many midlines do not require heparin. Your care team will tell you specifically whether heparin is part of your protocol.

**Before every use:** Flush with 10 mL saline to confirm patency (clear flow, no resistance) and clear any residue.

**After every use:** Flush with 10 mL saline to clear the medication from the catheter lumen.

**When not in active use:** Flush on the schedule your care team specifies — typically every 24 hours with saline.

### How to flush

1. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water (20 seconds minimum); dry completely.
2. Gather supplies: pre-filled 10 mL saline syringe, alcohol or CHG-alcohol wipe.
3. Scrub the needleless connector (the small cap at the end of the catheter) vigorously with an alcohol wipe for at least 15 seconds. Allow to air-dry 15 seconds.
4. Attach the saline syringe by twisting clockwise.
5. Gently and smoothly push the saline in. Do not force it if you feel significant resistance — stop and call your nurse.
6. Detach the syringe.

**Never use a syringe smaller than 10 mL.** Small syringes generate excessive pressure and can damage the catheter.

## Dressing Care

The transparent dressing over your insertion site is your front-line defense against infection. Keeping it intact is essential.

### Dressing change schedule
- **Transparent dressing (e.g., Tegaderm):** Change every 7 days, or immediately if it becomes loose, wet, soiled, or the edges begin to lift.
- **Gauze under transparent dressing:** Change every 48 hours (gauze traps moisture).

Dressing changes should be performed by a trained nurse — your home infusion nurse, visiting nurse, or at an outpatient clinic. Do not attempt to change the dressing yourself unless you have been specifically trained.

### Protecting the dressing
- Keep it dry. Use a waterproof PICC sleeve or wrap when showering.
- Do not apply lotion, cream, or products near the dressing.
- If the dressing begins to peel at the edges, do not try to press it back down. Call your nurse.
- Loose clothing over the arm is fine; avoid tight sleeves, compression garments, or blood pressure cuffs on the midline arm.

## Bathing with a Midline

**Showering:** Permitted with a waterproof sleeve or appropriate covering. Aim to keep water away from the dressing. After showering, check that the dressing is still intact and dry.

**Bathing/submerging:** Do not submerge the midline arm in bathwater, pools, hot tubs, lakes, or the ocean for the duration of use. Waterborne bacteria entering the dressing dramatically increases infection risk.

**Swimming:** Not permitted while the midline is in place.

## Activity with a Midline

Midlines generally allow more activity than PICCs, but some precautions apply:

**Generally fine:**
- Walking, daily activities, light exercise
- Driving (if your condition otherwise allows)
- Light lifting and normal household tasks

**Avoid or limit:**
- Heavy lifting or vigorous use of the midline arm (rough twisting, pushing, pulling)
- Contact sports or activities with risk of a direct hit to the arm
- Submerging the arm (see above)
- Blood pressure cuffs on the midline arm — always remind staff to use the other arm

**Unlike a PICC**, overhead reaching and more moderate arm activity are generally better tolerated with midlines because the catheter tip is not in the central vasculature. However, avoid any activity that causes pain or discomfort at the insertion site.

## Phlebitis: A Common Midline Complication

The most common complication with midline catheters is **phlebitis** — inflammation of the vein. It occurs more frequently with midlines than with central catheters because the catheter tip sits in a smaller vein.

**Signs of phlebitis:**
- Redness at or spreading from the insertion site
- Warmth along the vein
- A firm, rope-like feeling along the vein in the arm
- Pain or tenderness along the arm
- Swelling at the site

**What to do:** Report these signs to your nurse or home infusion nurse promptly. Mild phlebitis may be managed with warm compresses and elevation; in other cases the midline may need to be removed. Do not ignore these symptoms — they can progress.

**Signs that go beyond simple phlebitis and require urgent attention:**
- A red streak extending away from the site (spreading infection)
- Fever with the site changes
- Pus or discharge from the site

---

## Other Warning Signs

### Call your home care nurse for:
- Dressing loose, wet, lifting, or soiled
- Site looks red, swollen, or has any discharge
- Pain along the arm that is worsening
- Midline appears to have shifted (looks longer outside the skin than when it was placed)
- Resistance when flushing (do not force)
- Any concern about the site or infusion

### Go to the Emergency Room for:
- Fever (≥38°C / 100.4°F) with shaking chills
- Significant arm swelling spreading toward the shoulder or hand
- Shortness of breath or chest pain
- Signs of severe allergic reaction during infusion

---

## Duration and Removal

Midline catheters are designed for use up to **4 weeks**. Your care team will monitor its function and condition and remove it when treatment is complete or if it is no longer functioning safely.

Midline removal is quick and simple — no anesthesia, no stitches. The nurse applies gentle pressure at the site for a few minutes afterward. Brief tenderness and a small bruise are normal.

## Differences Between a Midline and a PICC: Quick Comparison

| Feature | Midline | PICC |
|---|---|---|
| Tip location | Upper arm / axillary vein | Central vein near heart |
| Blood draws | Generally not performed | Routinely done |
| TPN / IV nutrition | Not suitable | Suitable |
| Chemotherapy | Limited (check with team) | Suitable (most agents) |
| Heparin flush | Often not required | Sometimes required |
| Swimming | Not permitted | Not permitted |
| Max duration | ~4 weeks | Weeks to months |
