# Types of IV Lines and Catheters: What's the Difference?

There are several different kinds of vascular access devices, and it can be confusing when your care team mentions a PICC line, a central line, a port, or just an "IV." This guide explains the most common types in plain language — what they are, where they go in your body, and when and why each one is used.

## At a Glance

| Device | Inserted Into | Tip Location | Typical Duration | Who Places It |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Peripheral IV (PIV) | Small vein, hand/arm | Stays in the small vein | 3–4 days | Nurse |
| Midline catheter | Vein just above the elbow | Upper arm vein (not into chest) | Up to 4 weeks | Vascular access nurse |
| PICC line | Vein at/above the elbow | Large vein near the heart | Weeks to months | Vascular access nurse |
| Central venous catheter (CVC) | Neck, chest, or groin vein | Large vein near the heart | Days to weeks | Physician / APR |
| Tunneled catheter (e.g., Hickman) | Chest vein, tunneled under skin | Large vein near the heart | Months to years | Surgeon / IR |
| Implanted port | Chest vein (accessed by needle) | Large vein near the heart | Years | Surgeon / IR |

*IR = Interventional Radiologist; APR = Advanced Practice Provider*

## Peripheral Intravenous Catheter (PIV)

### What it is
A peripheral IV — often just called "an IV" — is a short, soft plastic tube (about 1–3 cm long) inserted into a small vein, usually on the back of the hand, the forearm, or the inside of the elbow. It is the most common type of vascular access device and is placed for short-term use.

### What it looks like
You will see a small piece of clear plastic tubing taped to your skin, with a connector on the end where IV tubing or a syringe can be attached. A transparent dressing holds it in place.

### When it's used
- Short-term IV fluids or medications (up to several days)
- Routine blood draws
- Emergency access
- Brief procedures

### Limitations
- Cannot safely deliver certain medications that would damage small veins (e.g., many chemotherapy drugs, long-term antibiotics, concentrated potassium, or IV nutrition)
- Must be changed regularly (typically every 72–96 hours, or sooner if problems develop)
- Small veins can be difficult to access in some patients, leading to multiple insertion attempts

### What to watch for
- Redness, swelling, or pain at the site (called **phlebitis** or **infiltration** — see our complications guide)
- The dressing becoming loose or wet
- Fluid leaking around the insertion site

---

## Midline Catheter

### What it is
A midline is longer than a peripheral IV (typically 8–20 cm) and is inserted into a larger vein above the elbow, in the upper arm. Unlike a PICC line, the tip of a midline does not extend all the way into the chest — it stays in the upper arm or shoulder area. This makes it more comfortable for extended use and suitable for a wider range of medications than a standard peripheral IV.

### When it's used
- IV therapy lasting 1–4 weeks
- Medications that are compatible with midline use (not highly irritating to veins)
- Patients who need longer-term IV access but not a full central line
- Patients with difficult peripheral veins

### Limitations
- Cannot be used for certain highly irritating medications (e.g., concentrated chemotherapy, TPN/IV nutrition, some vasopressors) — these require a central line
- Requires ultrasound guidance for placement
- Requires sterile technique for care

### Placement
Placed by a specially trained vascular access nurse using ultrasound guidance, usually at the bedside. A local anesthetic is used. The procedure takes 20–45 minutes.

## PICC Line (Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter)

### What it is
A PICC line is a long, thin, flexible catheter inserted through a vein in the upper arm. The catheter is threaded carefully through the venous system — through larger and larger veins — until the tip sits in the **superior vena cava**, a very large vein just above the heart. Because the tip is in a high-flow central vein, virtually any IV medication can be safely delivered through a PICC.

The word "peripherally inserted" means it is placed through a vein in the arm (the periphery) rather than directly into the chest or neck — making it safer and more comfortable to place than traditional central lines.

### When it's used
- Extended IV antibiotic therapy (often 2–6 weeks or longer)
- IV nutrition (TPN)
- Chemotherapy
- Any medication that cannot be given through a peripheral IV or midline
- Patients who need reliable IV access for weeks to months

### What it looks like
You will see a small dressing on your upper arm. One or two small connectors (called "hubs" or "lumens") extend from the dressing — these are where IV tubing is connected. A PICC with two separate channels is called a **double-lumen PICC** and allows two different medications to be given at the same time, or for blood to be drawn while an infusion runs.

### Placement
Placed by a vascular access nurse at the bedside, in a procedure room, or in interventional radiology. Ultrasound is used to find and access the vein. After placement, an X-ray or ECG confirmation confirms the tip is in the correct position before the PICC is used. The procedure typically takes 30–60 minutes.

### Care
PICC lines require regular flushing with saline (and sometimes heparin) to keep the catheter from clotting, regular dressing changes (typically every 7 days, or sooner if the dressing is loose or wet), and careful protection when bathing. See our guide: *Going Home with a PICC Line.*

## Central Venous Catheter (CVC) / Central Line

### What it is
A central venous catheter (CVC), or central line, is a catheter whose tip sits in a large central vein near the heart. Unlike a PICC, which is inserted through the arm, a traditional central line is inserted directly into a large vein in the neck (internal jugular vein), the upper chest (subclavian vein), or — less commonly — the groin (femoral vein).

CVCs can have one, two, or three separate channels (lumens), allowing multiple medications to be given simultaneously.

### When it's used
- Intensive care unit (ICU) patients requiring multiple medications, close monitoring, or emergency access
- Infusions that require very fast delivery
- Continuous monitoring of central venous blood pressure
- When other access options are not possible

### Placement
Placed by a physician or advanced practice provider, usually at the bedside in the ICU or in a procedure room. Local anesthetic and sometimes sedation are used. Ultrasound guidance is standard. An X-ray confirms placement before use.

### Duration
CVCs placed in the neck or chest are typically temporary (days to a few weeks) and are often converted to a PICC or tunneled catheter for longer-term needs.

## Tunneled Central Venous Catheter (e.g., Hickman, Broviac, Groshong)

### What it is
A tunneled catheter is a type of long-term central catheter. Like a standard central line, its tip sits in the large vein near the heart. What makes it different is how it is secured: the catheter is **tunneled** (passed) under the skin of the chest for several centimeters before exiting the skin. This tunnel helps anchor the catheter and creates a barrier that reduces infection risk.

Most tunneled catheters also have a small **cuff** — a soft felt ring on the catheter — that sits under the skin. Over several weeks, tissue grows into the cuff, securing the catheter in place without the need for stitches.

### When it's used
- Long-term IV therapy (months to years)
- Dialysis (certain types)
- Chemotherapy over extended periods
- Home IV therapy
- Patients who need central access but cannot or prefer not to have an implanted port

### What it looks like
One or more soft tubes exit the skin of the chest (usually just below the collarbone). These are capped when not in use and must be kept clean and covered.

## Implanted Port (Port-a-Cath, Power Port)

### What it is
An implanted port is the most permanent type of vascular access device. It consists of a small reservoir (the "port") about the size of a quarter, surgically placed under the skin of the chest. A catheter from the port runs into the large vein near the heart. The port itself is completely under the skin — nothing is visible on the outside when it is not being used.

To use the port, a special non-coring needle (a Huber needle) is inserted through the skin into the port reservoir. The needle is left in place during an infusion or access session, then removed. Each needle insertion feels like a brief sting — about like a routine blood draw.

### When it's used
- Long-term chemotherapy (months to years)
- Frequent blood draws and infusions over a long period
- IV medications or nutrition for patients who prefer a device that is completely hidden under the skin when not in use
- Patients with active lifestyles who need long-term access with minimal restrictions between uses

### Care between uses
When not actively being accessed, a port requires very little maintenance. It needs to be flushed with a heparin solution once a month (or per your care team's specific instructions) to prevent clotting, and the needle is removed after each access session. There is no external tubing or dressing to manage between uses. See our guide: *Going Home with an Implanted Port.*

## Intraosseous (IO) Access

An intraosseous device is inserted into the marrow space of a bone (usually the shinbone or sternum) and is used exclusively in emergency situations when rapid venous access cannot be achieved quickly. It is a temporary emergency measure and is replaced with a conventional vascular access device as soon as the patient is stabilized. You are unlikely to need to know about this device unless you experienced a medical emergency.

## How Does My Team Choose the Right Device for Me?

Your vascular access team considers several factors when recommending a device:

1. **What medications you need and for how long.** Certain drugs are too irritating for small veins; others are only needed for a day or two. The duration and type of treatment are the most important factors.

2. **The condition of your veins.** Some patients have very small, fragile, or difficult-to-find veins, which influences what is technically feasible.

3. **Your health conditions.** Certain conditions affect where a catheter can safely be placed (for example, a prior surgery or radiation to an area, a blood clotting disorder, or a history of vein problems).

4. **Your lifestyle and preferences.** For long-term access, your preferences about what the device looks like, how much care it requires at home, and your activity level all matter.

5. **The least invasive device for the job.** Your team aims to use the simplest, least invasive device that safely meets your clinical needs. This approach — called the "right device for the right patient for the right duration" — reduces unnecessary risk.

**You have the right to ask your care team:** "Why is this type of line recommended for me? Are there alternatives?" See our guide: *Questions to Ask Your Vascular Access Team.*
