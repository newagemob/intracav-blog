# PICC Removal: What to Expect

If you have a PICC line, there will come a point — when your treatment is complete, your clinical situation changes, or the catheter has served its purpose — when the PICC is removed. PICC removal is one of the simplest procedures in vascular access, but patients often have questions about what to expect. This guide explains the process.

---

## When Is a PICC Removed?

A PICC is removed when:

- **Treatment is complete.** The full course of IV antibiotics, chemotherapy, IV nutrition, or other infusion therapy is finished.
- **Oral therapy is now possible.** Your condition has improved to the point where you can absorb medications by mouth and IV access is no longer needed.
- **The PICC is no longer functioning.** If the catheter is blocked, damaged, or cannot be restored to function, removal and replacement (if still needed) may be required.
- **A complication has developed.** If CLABSI (bloodstream infection), thrombosis (blood clot), or significant site infection occurs, the PICC may need to be removed as part of treatment.
- **A different device is more appropriate.** If long-term IV access is needed (months to years), your care team may recommend transitioning to a tunneled catheter or implanted port, which requires removing the PICC first.
- **You or your care team decide it is no longer necessary.** Catheters that are no longer needed should not remain in place — every day a catheter is present is a day of unnecessary infection risk.

**Never remove a PICC yourself.** Even though PICC removal is simple for a trained nurse, pulling a catheter out improperly can cause complications including air embolism, bleeding, and catheter breakage.

## Who Removes a PICC?

PICC removal is performed by a registered nurse (RN) or other licensed clinician trained in the procedure. It does not require a physician, an operating room, or any specialized facility. It can be done:

- At the hospital bedside
- In a clinic or outpatient vascular access suite
- At home by your visiting nurse (most home infusion services include PICC removal)

If you are approaching the end of your IV therapy course, contact your home infusion coordinator or visiting nurse to schedule the removal. Do not wait for the PICC to be removed at a hospital appointment if a home nurse can do it sooner.

## What Happens During PICC Removal

PICC removal typically takes 5–10 minutes from setup to completion. Here is what you can expect:

### Preparation
Your nurse will:
- Verify your identity and confirm the reason for removal
- Ask you to lie flat or recline — this position reduces the risk of air being drawn into the vein during removal
- Wash hands and put on gloves
- Remove the dressing from your PICC site

### The removal itself
1. The nurse will ask you to take a slow, deep breath and hold it, or to hum or bear down slightly — this is called the **Valsalva maneuver** and raises the pressure in your chest veins, reducing the small risk of air embolism.
2. The catheter is withdrawn steadily and smoothly from the vein. Most patients feel a mild pulling sensation, described as similar to pulling a thread through tissue. There is usually **no significant pain**.
3. Immediately after the catheter is out, the nurse applies firm pressure to the site with sterile gauze.

### After withdrawal
- Firm pressure is held for at least **1–2 minutes** (longer if you are on anticoagulants or have bleeding tendencies).
- The nurse will inspect the removed catheter to confirm it came out intact. This is a safety check — the length removed should match the length inserted.
- A sterile dressing is applied to the site.
- You are asked to remain reclined for a few minutes before getting up.

## What Is Normal After PICC Removal

### At the site
- **Small amount of bleeding** that stops with pressure — normal
- **Small bruise** at the insertion site — normal; may take a few days to resolve
- **Mild tenderness** at the site for 1–2 days — normal
- **A small bump or firmness** along the vein track in the upper arm — can persist for a few weeks as the body heals the vein
- **Faint discoloration** along the vein track — normal; resolves over weeks

### How you feel
Most patients feel no different after PICC removal. Some feel a brief sense of relief or a slight odd sensation as the catheter withdraws — this is normal and brief.

---

## What to Watch for After Removal

Most PICC removals are uneventful. Occasionally, complications occur. Contact your care team if you notice:

**At the site:**
- Bleeding that does not stop within 15–20 minutes of firm, continuous pressure
- Significant bruising that is expanding rather than stable
- Increasing pain, redness, or swelling over the next 24–48 hours
- Pus or discharge from the site after the initial dressing
- A firm, cord-like, painful structure you can feel under the skin along the arm vein — this may indicate **superficial thrombophlebitis** (vein inflammation), which needs assessment

**Systemic symptoms:**
- Sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, or lightheadedness immediately after or within minutes of removal — seek emergency care; this could indicate air embolism (rare but serious)
- Fever developing within 24–48 hours of PICC removal when you were previously afebrile

**If the nurse reports concern during removal:**
If the nurse mentions that the catheter felt stuck, required unusual force, or the removed length does not match expectations — this needs to be followed up. A fragment of catheter remaining in the body requires urgent imaging and intervention.

## After the PICC Is Out: Wound Care

The site where the PICC was inserted is a small puncture wound that closes quickly in most patients. It typically closes within a few hours to a day. The dressing placed after removal:

- Should remain in place and clean for **at least 24 hours**
- Should be changed if it becomes wet, soiled, or loose
- Can usually be discontinued after 24–48 hours once the site is closed
- Keep the area clean and dry during initial healing

**Do not apply lotion, cream, or antiseptic to the site unless specifically instructed.**

---

## Returning to Normal Activity

Once the PICC is out, the main physical restrictions related to the catheter are lifted:

- **Bathing:** You may bathe and swim normally once the site is healed and closed (typically 24–48 hours)
- **Exercise:** Return to normal arm activity; there are no longer restrictions related to the PICC
- **Blood pressure cuffs and blood draws:** The arm that had the PICC can now be used for blood pressure and blood draws. However, note that the vein used for the PICC may be temporarily unusable for blood draws due to trauma to the vessel — if a blood draw from that arm is difficult, try the other arm

---

## Talking to Your Care Team

When your PICC is scheduled for removal, it is a good time to discuss:

- **What comes next clinically** — are you done with IV therapy entirely, or transitioning to oral medications or another device?
- **How to continue any IV medications** if a bridge period is needed before the PICC is removed
- **Whether follow-up labs are needed** after your treatment course ends
- **Signs of recurrence or treatment failure** to watch for now that active treatment is ending
