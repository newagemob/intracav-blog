# Skin Care Around Your Catheter Site

The skin around your catheter insertion site is the first line of defense against infection — and it is also vulnerable to injury from the adhesives, antiseptics, and repeated dressing changes required to keep the catheter secure and sterile. Healthy skin around the catheter site contributes directly to your safety. This guide explains what can happen to that skin and what you and your care team can do to protect it.

## Why Catheter Site Skin Is Vulnerable

Over the course of IV therapy — particularly with central catheters that remain in place for weeks or months — the skin at and around the insertion site is:

- **Repeatedly cleaned** with antiseptics (chlorhexidine, alcohol)
- **Repeatedly covered and uncovered** with adhesive dressings during regular changes
- **Sealed under an occlusive (airtight) dressing** between changes, which can trap moisture
- **Subjected to adhesive removal forces** that can be damaging to fragile or sensitive skin
- **Exposed to the mechanical presence** of the catheter itself exiting through the skin

Certain patients are at higher risk for skin complications:
- Older adults (skin becomes thinner, more fragile, less elastic with age)
- Patients on long-term corticosteroids (thins the skin)
- Patients with underlying skin conditions (eczema, psoriasis)
- Patients who have received radiation therapy to the area
- Patients with edema (swollen skin is more fragile)
- Patients who are malnourished or dehydrated
- Patients with compromised circulation

## Types of Skin Reactions at Catheter Sites

### Contact dermatitis from adhesives (most common)
Contact dermatitis is an inflammatory skin reaction caused by direct contact with a substance. With IV dressings, the two main causes are:

**Irritant contact dermatitis:** The skin becomes red, dry, itchy, and sometimes raw or blistered from the repeated mechanical and chemical irritation of adhesive application and removal. This is the most common type and does not require an immune response.

**Allergic contact dermatitis:** A true immune-mediated allergy to a component of the adhesive, antiseptic, or dressing material. This tends to appear with a defined outline corresponding exactly to where the product was applied and may worsen with repeated exposure.

Signs of contact dermatitis:
- Redness confined to the area under or around the dressing
- Itching at the dressing site
- Small blisters, oozing, or peeling within the dressing area
- Skin appearing red and shiny after dressing removal

### Medical adhesive-related skin injury (MARSI)
MARSI is damage caused specifically by the removal of adhesive products. The adhesive bonds more strongly to the skin than the skin bonds to the tissue beneath it, and removal strips away the outer layers of skin. MARSI can include:
- Skin tears — partial or full-thickness tears from aggressive adhesive removal
- Tension injuries — skin stretched and blistered from adhesive pulling
- Stripping injuries — repeated removal of skin cells with each dressing change

Signs of MARSI:
- Skin looking raw, shiny, or "de-skinned" in the area where the dressing was
- Skin tears — a flap of skin with a clearly traumatized wound bed beneath
- Pain during or after dressing removal

### Moisture-associated skin damage (maceration)
When moisture becomes trapped under the dressing — from perspiration, wound drainage, or external water — the skin softens and weakens, eventually breaking down. This is called maceration.

Signs of maceration:
- Skin looking white, soft, and waterlogged under the dressing
- Skin that easily tears or rubs away
- Wrinkled or pruned-looking skin around the exit site

### Folliculitis
Bacterial infection of hair follicles, which can occur in areas with hair near the catheter dressing (e.g., the inner arm, the chest). Appears as small red pimple-like bumps under or near the dressing.

### Chlorhexidine (CHG) skin reaction
Some patients develop a reaction to chlorhexidine, the antiseptic used routinely for catheter site care. This can range from mild skin redness to a significant allergic reaction. Signs include burning, redness, and rash at the site of CHG application.

## Preventing Skin Complications

### Choosing the right dressing
Your vascular access nurse selects appropriate dressing products for your skin type. If you have a history of sensitive skin or adhesive reactions, tell your nurse **before** the first dressing is applied. Options available include:

- **Standard transparent film dressings** (e.g., Tegaderm)
- **Silicone-based adhesive dressings** — gentler on fragile skin; the adhesive bonds to skin differently (does not bond as aggressively) and removes more gently
- **Hydrocolloid borders** — for patients with extremely fragile skin
- **Non-adhesive securement devices** — secure the catheter without adhesive contact with the skin

### Safe dressing removal technique
How the dressing is removed matters as much as what product is used:

- **Stretch parallel to the skin (zero-degree removal):** Rather than pulling the dressing upward away from the skin, stretch it parallel to the skin surface while holding the skin. This reduces the tensile force on the skin.
- **Lift slowly and steadily:** Rapid removal tears skin. Slow, steady tension is less traumatic.
- **Adhesive remover products:** Silicone-based adhesive removers (available as wipes or spray) dissolve the adhesive bond before removal, dramatically reducing skin damage risk. Ask your nurse if these are available.
- **Never rip:** If a dressing seems stuck, apply adhesive remover rather than forcing removal.

### Managing moisture
- Transparent film dressings should be changed before they accumulate excessive moisture underneath
- If your skin perspires heavily, notify your nurse — more frequent dressing changes or modified products may be needed
- CHG bathing cloths should be applied and allowed to air-dry before dressing changes

### Skin preparation products
Some facilities use a liquid skin barrier wipe (e.g., Cavilon No-Sting Barrier Film) applied to the peri-site skin before the dressing is placed. This provides a protective coating between the skin and the adhesive, reducing both contact dermatitis and MARSI risk. If you have sensitive skin, ask whether this is available.

### Rotating the site within safe parameters
While the catheter itself cannot be moved without clinical justification, the exact placement of the securement device and dressing borders can sometimes be slightly varied with each change to avoid repeatedly traumatizing exactly the same skin. Ask your vascular access nurse.

## For Patients with Specific High-Risk Skin Conditions

### Older adult patients
- Alert your care team to any pre-existing skin fragility before the first dressing
- Request silicone-based adhesives or adhesive remover as standard practice
- Report any skin changes — even minor ones — at each nursing visit; do not wait for the next scheduled dressing change

### Patients on corticosteroids
- Corticosteroid-thinned skin bruises and tears very easily
- Request the gentlest available adhesive products
- Extra care during adhesive removal is essential

### Patients who have received radiation
- Radiation-damaged skin may never fully recover to normal integrity
- The radiated area has reduced blood supply and reduced healing capacity
- Avoid placing IV dressings over irradiated skin when at all possible; discuss with your care team

### Patients with eczema or psoriasis
- Avoid placing dressings over active eczema or psoriasis plaques
- Inform your care team of any flare in advance of a dressing change

## What to Do If Skin Problems Develop

### Mild redness or irritation at the dressing margins
- Report this to your vascular access nurse at the next visit or earlier
- Do not apply cream or lotion under the dressing — this can compromise adhesion and create a moist, bacteria-friendly environment
- Your nurse may switch to a different dressing product

### Skin tear or significant skin breakdown
- Report immediately — do not wait for the scheduled dressing change
- Keep the area clean and covered with a clean cloth if the dressing is off
- A skin tear is a wound that requires proper wound care assessment

### Suspected contact allergy
- Document what product was applied and when the reaction appeared
- Report to your care team
- If the reaction is severe (widespread redness, blistering, significant pain), this needs prompt assessment
- Patch testing (a formal allergy test) may be recommended if reactions recur with multiple products

### Persistent or worsening skin breakdown
- If skin around the catheter site continues to deteriorate despite product changes, consider wound care specialist consultation
- Your care team may involve a wound ostomy continence nurse (WOCN) to assess and recommend specialized products

## At Home: What You Can Do

- **Inspect the dressing and surrounding skin daily.** Look for: redness at the dressing edges, any skin peeling or rawness visible at the dressing margins, any moisture visible under the film
- **Do not apply any products to the skin under or near the dressing** unless specifically instructed (no lotion, no cream, no antiseptic)
- **Keep the dressing dry** (use waterproof protection during bathing)
- **Report changes** to your home infusion nurse before the next scheduled dressing change if you see anything concerning
