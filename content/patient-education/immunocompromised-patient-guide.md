# Vascular Access Safety for Immunocompromised Patients

If your immune system is compromised — by chemotherapy, an organ or stem cell transplant, HIV, long-term corticosteroids, biologics, or other immunosuppressant medications — you face a higher risk of infection from vascular access devices than the general patient population. Understanding why this is, what it means in practice, and how to protect yourself is essential.

## What Does "Immunocompromised" Mean?

Your immune system is your body's defense network — the collection of white blood cells, antibodies, and other mechanisms that identify and destroy bacteria, viruses, and fungi before they cause serious illness.

"Immunocompromised" means this defense system is weakened, either by disease or by treatment. Common causes include:

- **Chemotherapy:** Many anti-cancer drugs damage the bone marrow, reducing production of neutrophils (the white blood cells that fight bacterial infection) — a condition called neutropenia
- **Stem cell and organ transplantation:** Transplant recipients receive powerful immunosuppressant medications to prevent rejection, which also suppress the immune response to infection
- **HIV/AIDS:** The HIV virus depletes CD4 T-cells, weakening immune response
- **High-dose or long-term corticosteroids** (prednisone, methylprednisolone): Suppress multiple aspects of immune function
- **Biologic therapies** (e.g., TNF inhibitors like infliximab, etanercept; anti-CD20 agents like rituximab): Target specific components of the immune response
- **Other immunosuppressants** (mycophenolate, tacrolimus, azathioprine): Used in transplant, autoimmune disease, and inflammatory conditions

If you take any of these medications or have these conditions, the information in this guide applies to you.

## Why Infection Risk Is Higher with a Catheter

Any catheter in a blood vessel creates a potential entry point for bacteria and fungi. In a person with a normal immune system, even if bacteria enter through a catheter, the immune system can usually eliminate them before serious infection develops. In an immunocompromised person, this natural defense is impaired — a small number of bacteria entering through a catheter can multiply rapidly and cause life-threatening bloodstream infection.

Additionally:
- Infections that would be mild in an immunocompetent person can be devastating in an immunocompromised patient
- Classic signs of infection (redness, warmth, visible pus) may be absent or minimal because the inflammatory response itself is dampened
- Fever can be the only reliable sign of serious infection
- Organisms that are normally harmless (opportunistic organisms) can cause serious infections in immunocompromised hosts

## Fever Is an Emergency

**This is the most important thing in this guide.** In an immunocompromised patient with a central catheter:

> **A temperature of ≥38°C / 100.4°F (or ≥38.3°C / 100.9°F by some protocols) is a medical emergency. Go to the emergency room or call your care team's after-hours line immediately — do not wait until morning.**

This is called **febrile neutropenia** (if you are neutropenic) or simply fever with central line-associated risk. The ER will:
- Draw blood cultures (from the catheter and from a peripheral vein)
- Start IV broad-spectrum antibiotics within 1 hour of arrival (this is a quality metric)
- Evaluate for the source of infection

**Do not:**
- Take acetaminophen (Tylenol) to reduce the fever before calling/going — this masks the fever and can delay your recognition that something is wrong
- Wait to see if the fever "breaks" on its own
- Wait until the next morning to call your care team

**Do note:** Some oncology and transplant programs have very specific fever management protocols — which medications to take, what temperature threshold to use, whether to call before going to the ER or go directly. **Know your team's protocol in advance and follow it exactly.**

## Enhanced Infection Prevention Measures

Beyond standard catheter care precautions (see our main infection prevention guide), immunocompromised patients should follow these enhanced measures:

### Strict hand hygiene — for you and everyone around you
Wash your hands or use alcohol hand gel:
- Before and after touching anything near your catheter
- Before eating and after using the bathroom
- After being in any public place
- Before and after any contact with visitors

Require all visitors to perform hand hygiene upon arrival. This is not excessive — it is appropriate.

### Limit visitors when counts are very low
During periods of severe neutropenia (ask your oncology team what ANC level triggers this), limit exposure to crowds and large groups of visitors. Anyone who is ill — even mildly (cold, mild diarrhea, recent exposure to illness) — should not visit in person.

### Daily CHG bathing
If you have a central line, CHG (chlorhexidine gluconate) daily bathing has been shown to significantly reduce CLABSI risk. Your care team should have initiated this. If you are at home and were not given CHG bathing cloths, ask your home infusion nurse or primary care team about them.

### Dressing integrity vigilance
The dressing over your PICC or tunneled catheter exit site is especially critical for immunocompromised patients. Check it daily:
- Intact on all edges
- No lifting, bubbling, or moisture under the film
- No visible soiling

A loose dressing in a neutropenic patient requires prompt professional replacement — do not leave it until a scheduled change if it is compromised.

### Limit unnecessary catheter manipulations
Every time the catheter is accessed, the risk of bacteria entering increases marginally. Ensure your catheter is accessed only when needed:
- Lab draws and infusions should be consolidated whenever possible
- Do not allow the catheter to be accessed for trivial reasons
- Ensure sterile technique (scrub the hub, use alcohol caps) is used every time

## Signs of Infection May Be Subtle or Absent

As noted above, classic inflammatory signs can be dampened or absent in immunocompromised patients. You may not see redness, pus, or dramatic swelling at the catheter site. Watch for:

**Exit site (PICC or tunneled catheter):**
- Any redness, even mild
- Any discharge, even minimal
- Tenderness at the site
- Skin that looks different around the site

**Systemic (whole body):**
- Fever — the most important sign
- Chills — may occur with or before fever
- Feeling suddenly worse, confused, or very weak — "I don't feel right"
- Rapid heart rate

**Report any of these immediately.** Do not minimize symptoms. Your care team would rather you call at 2 AM for a false alarm than miss an early infection.

## Oral Care and Mucositis

Patients on chemotherapy or post-transplant frequently develop mucositis — sores and inflammation in the mouth and throat. The mouth is normally colonized by many bacteria; when the mucous membranes break down, bacteria can enter the bloodstream — even without a catheter.

Oral care during chemotherapy and transplant:
- Gentle brushing (soft-bristle toothbrush) after every meal and before bed
- Saline or sodium bicarbonate mouth rinses several times daily
- Avoid commercial alcohol-based mouthwashes (they dry the mucosa)
- Report significant oral pain, difficulty eating/drinking, or extensive ulceration to your care team promptly

---

## Antifungal and Antibiotic Prophylaxis

Many immunocompromised patients are prescribed **prophylactic antibiotics or antifungals** — medications taken not because of active infection, but to prevent infection during the period of highest risk. Common examples:

- Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) — PCP (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) prophylaxis
- Fluconazole or micafungin — antifungal prophylaxis for transplant patients
- Acyclovir/valacyclovir — antiviral prophylaxis (herpes/CMV)
- Levofloxacin — antibacterial prophylaxis during chemotherapy nadir in some protocols

**Take prophylactic medications exactly as prescribed.** These are not optional. Do not stop them because you feel well.

---

## Immunizations and Live Vaccines

- **Do not receive live vaccines** during immunosuppression (e.g., MMR, varicella, yellow fever, live flu vaccine). Live vaccines can cause serious infection in immunocompromised individuals.
- **Inactivated vaccines** (flu shot, pneumococcal, COVID-19 mRNA) are generally safe but may have reduced effectiveness during active immunosuppression
- **Family members and close contacts** should receive inactivated flu vaccines annually to reduce transmission risk to you
- Discuss your complete vaccine schedule with your care team — there are specific timing recommendations for vaccines before and after transplant, chemotherapy, and biologic therapy

---

## Coordinating Care Across Multiple Providers

Immunocompromised patients often see multiple specialists — oncologist, transplant physician, infectious disease, primary care, and others. Ensure all providers know:

- Your current immune status and why you are immunocompromised
- All medications you are taking (including immunosuppressants)
- Your vascular access device type and location
- Your fever threshold and fever management protocol

This is particularly important in emergency situations (ER, urgent care) where providers may not have access to your complete records.
