# Guide for Caregivers of Adult Patients on IV Therapy

This guide is written specifically for **you** — the spouse, partner, parent, adult child, friend, or other person who is providing hands-on support to someone receiving home IV therapy. You are providing an enormous service, and you deserve information, support, and acknowledgment of both your role and your limits.

---

## Your Role as a Caregiver

The care needs of patients on home IV therapy vary widely. Your role may involve:

- Being present while the patient self-manages an infusion (for support and as a backup in case of problems)
- Managing the actual infusion when the patient cannot do so independently
- Performing catheter flushes
- Assisting with or monitoring dressing care (though professional dressing changes should remain with trained nurses)
- Driving to appointments and lab draws
- Managing medication deliveries, storage, and supplies
- Being the person who calls for help when something goes wrong
- Providing emotional support through a difficult treatment period

Knowing which of these you are being asked to take on — and which require professional nursing — matters. **You are not a trained nurse.** Your role is to support the patient and maintain safety, not to perform clinical procedures beyond what you have been specifically trained to do.

---

## What You Should Be Trained to Do (if applicable)

If you will be performing any hands-on catheter care tasks, you must be trained by a healthcare professional before doing so:

- **Flushing the catheter:** Includes the correct technique, syringe size, scrubbing the hub, recognizing and responding to resistance
- **Connecting and disconnecting IV tubing:** Proper aseptic technique; clamping Hickman-type catheters
- **Recognizing and responding to pump alarms:** Understanding what each alarm means and the correct first response

**You should not perform catheter care tasks that you have not been specifically trained and observed performing.** If the home infusion nurse's teaching was rushed, interrupted, or you felt unprepared, say so before taking over responsibilities: "I'm not confident with this yet. Can we practice once more?"

---

## The Most Important Things You Can Do

### 1. Know the emergency contacts
Post them visibly in the home. Know when to call the home infusion nurse vs. when to call 911 or go to the ER. The key trigger for ER: **fever ≥38°C / 100.4°F with shaking chills** in someone with a central catheter.

### 2. Watch the patient
You may notice changes before they do: the patient looking flushed, seeming unusually confused, shivering, or clutching their arm. Trust your observations and speak up. You are an extra set of eyes.

### 3. Support consistent adherence
Gently help the patient stay on schedule with infusions, flushes, and lab draws. This is not nagging — it is clinical support. Missed doses and skipped labs can compromise treatment outcomes.

### 4. Be present for complications
If something goes wrong — pump alarm, leaking line, suspected catheter problem — being present and calm is critical. Review the emergency sections of our specific device guides so you know what to do if a catheter falls out, a connection comes apart, or the patient develops fever.

### 5. Don't improvise
If you are unsure whether something is normal or not, call. Do not try to improvise a solution to a catheter problem. The right answer is almost always: call the home infusion nurse.

## Specific Caregiver Tasks by Scenario

### If the IV pump alarms
1. Do not panic — most alarms are minor
2. Read the alarm message on the display
3. Common responses:
   - **"Air in line":** Do not disconnect anything; call the home infusion nurse or follow instructions if you have been trained to address air in line
   - **"Occlusion":** Check for kinked tubing; if no obvious kink, call the nurse; do not force flush
   - **"Infusion complete":** Infusion has finished; the patient's catheter still needs to be flushed; call the nurse or follow trained instructions
4. You can silence a beeping alarm (usually a "silence" or "mute" button) while you address or call about the cause

### If the dressing becomes loose or wet
- Do not try to replace the dressing yourself with household tape or non-sterile materials
- Cover the area loosely with a clean cloth to protect from contamination
- Call the home infusion nurse — the dressing must be changed with sterile materials and technique

### If the catheter appears to have partially come out
- Do not push it back in
- Keep the site clean and covered
- Call the home infusion nurse immediately; follow their guidance

### If the catheter completely falls out
- Keep the catheter
- Apply gentle pressure to the site
- Go to the emergency room
- Bring the removed catheter with you

### If the patient develops fever and chills during the night
- Take the temperature to confirm
- Do not wait until morning if temp is ≥38°C / 100.4°F with shaking chills
- Call the home infusion after-hours line first; they will advise whether to go to the ER — in most cases, the answer will be yes
- Help the patient gather what they need for the ER (ID, medication list, port card)

---

## When the Patient Cannot Self-Advocate

If the patient is cognitively impaired, sedated, or too ill to communicate clearly, you become their medical advocate. Keep with you:

- A written list of the patient's current medications and doses
- The type and location of the vascular access device
- Any allergies
- The primary physician's name and phone number
- An alert card with critical information (see our ER Visit guide for a template)

In the ER or in any new clinical setting, proactively communicate: "They have a [PICC / port] in their [arm/chest]. Their primary doctor is [name]. They are allergic to [list]. They are currently on [medication]."

---

## Setting Realistic Limits

Caregiving is a marathon, not a sprint — especially for lengthy treatment courses. Recognizing your limits is not a failure; it is a prerequisite for sustainable caregiving.

**Signs you may be approaching your limit:**
- Difficulty sleeping even when you have the opportunity
- Persistent anxiety, irritability, or low mood
- Feeling like you cannot make a mistake — hypervigilance and exhaustion
- Resentment (followed by guilt about the resentment)
- Neglecting your own medical appointments, social connections, or basic needs
- Feeling like there is no one else who could do this

**What to do:**
- Talk to the patient's social worker — they support families, not just patients
- Ask about respite care (temporary relief care) through the home infusion agency or hospital social work department
- Reach out to friends and family for specific practical help (meal delivery, driving the patient to appointments)
- Take breaks — even 30 minutes away from caregiving can restore perspective
- Do not try to absorb all the anxiety of the situation yourself

---

## Caring for Your Own Health

It is very common for caregivers to put their own health on hold during a family member's illness. This is understandable but harmful.

- Keep your own medical appointments
- Sleep when you can — being chronically sleep-deprived impairs judgment and increases error risk
- Eat adequately — this sounds obvious but caregivers often skip meals
- Be honest with your own physician if you are experiencing caregiver stress or burnout symptoms
- If you are experiencing depression, anxiety, or burnout that is affecting your functioning, these are treatable conditions — seek support

---

## When to Ask for More Professional Support

You should advocate for increased professional support when:

- The patient's care needs exceed what you can safely provide at home
- You are being asked to perform tasks you were not adequately trained for
- The patient has frequent complications requiring professional management
- You are physically unable to provide the required assistance (due to your own health, physical limitations, or geography)
- The treatment is longer or more complex than originally anticipated

It is appropriate to tell the home infusion coordinator or the patient's care team: "I'm struggling to manage [specific task] safely. Can we adjust the plan to include more professional nursing visits?"
