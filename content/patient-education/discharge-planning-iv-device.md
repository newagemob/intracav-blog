# Discharge Planning: Leaving the Hospital with an IV Device

Leaving the hospital with an IV catheter — whether a PICC line, a midline, or a port that is being actively used — means transitioning to home or outpatient care. This guide helps you understand what needs to be in place before you leave, who will support you at home, and how to set yourself up for a safe, successful recovery.

## The Goal: A Safe and Supported Discharge

A safe discharge is not just about physically leaving the building. It means going home with:

- A functioning, well-positioned catheter
- Adequate supplies
- Clear instructions you understand
- A scheduled home care nurse or infusion center
- Medications confirmed and ready
- Emergency contacts and a clear plan for when things go wrong

If any of these pieces are missing, you or your advocate should ask your care team to address them before discharge. **It is appropriate to say: "I do not feel ready to go home yet." Your care team can work with you to address the gaps.**

## Before You Leave: Your Pre-Discharge Checklist

Work through this checklist with your nurse or case manager before discharge:

### About your catheter
- [ ] The catheter site has been assessed and the dressing is clean, dry, and secure
- [ ] You know which catheter you have (PICC, midline, port) and where it is located
- [ ] For PICCs: you know the external catheter length (in cm), written down
- [ ] You have been told the care and activity limitations specific to your catheter type

### About your medications and infusions
- [ ] You know the name(s) of the IV medication(s) you will receive at home
- [ ] You know the dose, schedule, and expected duration of treatment
- [ ] You know how to connect, disconnect, and manage your home infusion (or a nurse will manage this)
- [ ] You know how to flush your catheter (or understand that your home nurse will do this)
- [ ] Your medications have been ordered through a home infusion pharmacy
- [ ] Medication delivery to your home has been confirmed
- [ ] You know how to store your medications (refrigeration? room temperature?)

### About your supplies
- [ ] You have (or supplies are being delivered with) your first dressing change kit
- [ ] You have flush syringes (saline and/or heparin as prescribed)

- [ ] You know the name of your home infusion agency / visiting nurse service
- [ ] You have the daytime phone number AND the after-hours/emergency number
- [ ] If no home nurse is coming, you know where to go for dressing changes (outpatient clinic, infusion center)
- [ ] A family member or caregiver who will be with you knows the basics of your care needs

### About follow-up care
- [ ] A follow-up appointment with your physician or specialist is scheduled (with date, time, location, and purpose written down)
- [ ] Any required lab tests are scheduled, and you know where to go
- [ ] You know who is managing your overall care going forward

## Home Infusion: How It Works

Many patients receive IV therapy at home through a **home infusion program.** This is a coordinated service involving:

**The home infusion pharmacy:** A specialized pharmacy that prepares your IV medications in sterile bags or cassettes and delivers them to your home on a regular schedule. They also supply equipment such as infusion pumps, tubing, and flush syringes.

**The home infusion nurse:** A registered nurse who comes to your home to assess you, teach you how to manage your infusion and catheter, perform dressing changes, and monitor for complications. Depending on your setup, visits may be daily, several times per week, or weekly — with you managing the infusions yourself between visits.

**The coordination team:** A case manager or home infusion coordinator who tracks your treatment, ensures prescription refills are processed, monitors your labs, and communicates between your infusion pharmacy, visiting nurse, and physician.

### What a first home infusion nurse visit typically includes
- Confirming the catheter is functioning correctly
- Reviewing or performing a dressing change
- Teaching you to connect and disconnect your infusion (if self-administered)
- Teaching you to flush the catheter
- Reviewing your medication, dose, and schedule
- Leaving emergency contact information
- Answering all your questions

**This visit is important.** Be present, be rested, and bring a family member if possible so there is a second pair of ears. Write down anything you are uncertain about.

## Self-Managed vs. Nurse-Managed Infusions

Some patients administer their own IV infusions at home (with training). Others have nurses come to the home for every administration. Which applies to you depends on:

- The type of medication (some drugs require monitoring that cannot be done at home)
- Your physical and cognitive ability to manage the infusion
- Your home environment and available support
- Your comfort level after training

**Self-managed infusions** typically use an electronic ambulatory infusion pump (a small, portable pump that can be worn in a pouch or carried in a bag) or gravity-based systems. Training before discharge is critical.

**There is no shame in saying "I am not confident in doing this myself."** If you are not comfortable managing your infusion, your care team should arrange for a nurse to come to your home for each administration.

## Medications: Storage, Handling, and Scheduling

### Storage
Most IV antibiotics and other home infusion medications require **refrigeration.** The pharmacy will tell you specifically what temperature range is needed. Common rules:
- Keep refrigerated medications in a designated, clean spot in the refrigerator, away from food and out of reach of children
- Remove from the refrigerator 30–45 minutes before infusion time to allow warming to room temperature — cold infusions can be uncomfortable and may affect drug stability
- Never freeze IV medications unless specifically instructed
- Check the expiration date on every bag before use
- Never use a bag that looks cloudy, contains particles, or has a broken seal

### Scheduling
IV antibiotics especially must be given at consistent times to maintain steady drug levels in your blood. If a dose must be delayed, do not double up — contact your home infusion nurse or pharmacy for guidance.

### Running low on supplies or medications
Contact your home infusion pharmacy at least 2–3 days before you expect to run out. Do not wait until you have only one dose left. Delivery may take 24–48 hours.

## Living at Home with an IV Catheter

### Create a dedicated care space
Set up a clean, well-lit area in your home for catheter care, infusion, and supplies. This reduces contamination risk and makes the process easier.

### Organize your supplies
- Keep flush syringes, alcohol wipes, and dressing supplies organized and within easy reach
- Store them away from moisture, heat, and direct sunlight
- Keep a log or calendar of your infusion schedule, flush schedule, and dressing change dates

### Plan for your daily life
- Infusion schedules can be worked around many activities. Discuss with your home infusion nurse if you want to time your infusions to accommodate work, sleep, or other activities.
- Plan bathing around dressing care (see your specific device guide for detailed instructions)
- Keep emergency contact numbers posted in a visible location — on the refrigerator is a common choice

### Involve your support network
Recovery at home is much smoother with support. Consider:
- Asking a family member or trusted friend to be present for the first few home infusions
- Having someone available to call in an emergency
- Not isolating — your mental health matters during a difficult treatment course

---

## Lab Monitoring at Home

Many IV medications require regular blood tests to monitor:

- **Drug levels** (e.g., vancomycin trough levels, aminoglycoside levels): ensures the drug is at a safe and effective concentration
- **Kidney function** (creatinine, BUN): some antibiotics and other drugs can affect kidney function
- **Liver function, blood counts, electrolytes**: depending on your medication and condition

Your care team will give you a specific lab schedule. Labs can often be drawn by your home infusion nurse, at an outpatient lab near your home, or at your follow-up appointments. **Do not skip lab draws** — abnormal results may require dose adjustments to prevent harm.

## What to Expect Emotionally

Going home from the hospital with a catheter can feel strange, scary, or overwhelming. This is completely normal. You may feel:

- Anxiety about managing the catheter on your own
- Worry about something going wrong
- Frustration at the disruption to your normal routine
- Relief to be home, mixed with uncertainty

All of these feelings are valid. Here are some suggestions:

- **Write everything down.** You will not remember everything you are told at discharge. Notes, checklists, and written instructions are your safety net.
- **Practice before you leave.** If you will be self-managing flushes or infusions, practice under supervision in the hospital or clinic until you feel confident. Ask to practice again if the first time was not enough.
- **Ask questions freely.** No question is too small. Your home infusion nurse expects questions, especially in the first week.
- **Advocate for yourself.** If something does not seem right, trust your instincts and call.
- **Give yourself time.** Most patients become much more comfortable with their catheter care within a week of going home. The first few days are the steepest part of the learning curve.

## Transition of Care: Preventing Communication Gaps

One of the most important aspects of a safe discharge is ensuring that your care information is communicated correctly to everyone who needs to know. Communication failures during care transitions are a well-documented source of medical errors.

**To protect yourself:**

- Ask for a copy of your discharge summary (a document summarizing your diagnosis, treatment, medications, and follow-up plan). Review it and bring it to all follow-up appointments.
- Confirm that your primary care physician has been notified of your discharge and treatment plan.
- Confirm that the home infusion pharmacy has received all necessary prescriptions.
- Ensure your follow-up physicians can access your hospital records if they are with a different health system.

If you are going to a **skilled nursing facility (SNF)** or **rehabilitation facility** rather than home, ensure that facility's nursing staff receives your catheter care instructions and medication details before you arrive.

## When to Call vs. When to Go to the ER

**Call your home infusion nurse or care team when:**
- The dressing is loose, wet, or falling off
- The site looks slightly red or has mild tenderness
- The pump is alarming (follow instructions in our infusion guide, then call)
- You have questions about your care
- You feel uncertain about any aspect of your catheter management
- You are running low on supplies or medications

**Go to the Emergency Room (or call 911) when:**
- **Fever (≥38°C / 100.4°F) with shaking chills** — possible bloodstream infection
- **Shortness of breath or chest pain**
- **Swelling of the arm (PICC) or neck/face** — possible blood clot or thrombosis
- **Signs of severe allergic reaction** — throat swelling, difficulty breathing, hives spreading rapidly
- **The catheter completely comes out** — bring the catheter with you
- **Uncontrolled bleeding from the site**
- Any situation that feels like an emergency
