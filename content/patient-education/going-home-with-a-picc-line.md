# Going Home with a PICC Line: Your Complete Care Guide

Going home with a PICC line may feel overwhelming at first. With proper instruction and a little practice, most patients manage their PICC comfortably and confidently at home. This guide covers everything you need to know about caring for your PICC after hospital discharge.

**Important:** This guide provides general education. Your specific PICC care instructions — flushing volumes, flush schedules, dressing change schedule, and activity restrictions — will be given to you by your nurse before discharge. Follow *your* instructions when they differ from anything described here.

## Before You Leave the Hospital: What to Confirm

Before going home with a PICC line, your nurse should have reviewed the following with you. If anything on this list has not been covered, ask before you leave:

- [ ] The PICC dressing has been changed within the last 7 days and is clean, dry, and secure
- [ ] You know the external length of the PICC (how many centimeters protrude from your arm) — write it down
- [ ] You or your caregiver have been trained to flush the PICC correctly
- [ ] You have a home infusion nurse or outpatient infusion center scheduled
- [ ] You have a supply of: saline flush syringes, heparin flush syringes (if prescribed), dressing change supplies, and any infusion equipment
- [ ] You know the name and phone number of your home infusion nurse and the after-hours emergency line
- [ ] You know the signs of complications and when to go to the ER
- [ ] You know your follow-up appointment schedule (including PICC dressing changes)
- [ ] All questions have been answered

## Understanding Your PICC

Your PICC line was placed in a vein in your upper arm. The tip of the catheter sits in the superior vena cava, a large vein just above your heart. The part of the catheter that you can see and feel exits your skin at the insertion site, usually just above the elbow on the inner (antecubital) side of the arm.

Your PICC may have **one lumen** (one channel/tube) or **two lumens** (two separate channels). Each lumen must be flushed separately.

The PICC is secured to your arm with a securement device (often a small adhesive patch) and covered with a transparent dressing that allows you to see the site.

**Write down and remember:**
- Which arm: Left / Right (circle one)
- External length (cm): _____
- Number of lumens: One / Two
- Flush schedule: _____________________________

## Flushing Your PICC Line

Flushing keeps the catheter from clogging with blood clots. Your home care nurse may teach you to flush your own PICC, or your home infusion nurse may do all flushes for you. Know which applies to you.

### Why flushing matters
Blood can back up into the tip of the catheter when it is not in use, forming a clot that blocks the line. Regular flushing with saline clears the catheter. Some catheters also require heparin (a blood thinner) flushed in after the saline to further prevent clotting — your care team will tell you if this applies to your PICC.

### General flushing principles

**Before every use:**
Flush with saline first to confirm the line is open and to clear any residue.

**After every use:**
Flush with saline after each infusion or blood draw. Follow with heparin if prescribed. Use the **SASH** technique when heparin is involved:
- **S** — Saline flush
- **A** — Administer the medication (or access for blood draw)
- **S** — Saline flush
- **H** — Heparin flush (if prescribed)

**When not in use:**
Flush on the schedule your team provides — typically every 24 hours for saline-only PICCs, and per specific instructions for heparin-locked PICCs.

### How to flush (general steps)

Your nurse will demonstrate this specifically, but the general process is:

1. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water (at least 20 seconds) and dry completely.
2. Gather supplies: pre-filled saline flush syringe (10 mL, as instructed) and/or heparin flush syringe, alcohol wipes or CHG-alcohol wipes.
3. Scrub the cap (the small connector at the end of each PICC lumen) vigorously with an alcohol wipe — typically 15 seconds of scrubbing, then allow to air dry for 15 seconds. This is called "scrub the hub."
4. Attach the saline syringe to the cap by twisting it clockwise.
5. Gently push the saline into the line using a slow, smooth push. Do **not** force the flush if you feel significant resistance — stop and call your home care nurse.
6. Complete the flush using a positive pressure technique as instructed.
7. Detach the syringe.
8. Repeat for the second lumen if you have a double-lumen PICC.
9. Repeat with the heparin syringe if prescribed.

**Never use a syringe smaller than 10 mL to flush your PICC.** Smaller syringes generate higher pressure and can damage the catheter.

## PICC Dressing Care

The dressing over your insertion site keeps the area clean, sterile, and protected. Keeping it intact is one of the most important things you can do.

### Dressing change schedule
- **Transparent dressing (Tegaderm or similar):** Change every 7 days, or sooner if loose, wet, dirty, or the border is peeling.
- **Gauze under transparent dressing:** Change every 48 hours (gauze absorbs moisture and becomes a breeding ground for bacteria).
- **Your schedule:** _____________________________

Dressing changes should be done by a trained healthcare provider — your home infusion nurse, visiting nurse, or at an outpatient clinic. If you or a caregiver are taught to change the dressing, use exactly the technique your nurse demonstrated.

### Protecting the dressing between changes

**Keep it dry:** Water weakening the adhesive can allow bacteria to enter the site. Before bathing:
- Use a **specialized waterproof PICC sleeve or cover** (available from medical supply stores or provided by your home infusion service). These allow you to shower while keeping the dressing completely dry.
- Alternatively, plastic wrap (like Saran wrap) secured with waterproof tape above and below the dressing can work in a pinch, but purpose-made sleeves are more reliable.
- **Submerging your PICC arm in water — bathtub, pool, ocean, hot tub — is not permitted** for the duration of PICC use.

**Do not peel or lift the dressing edges.** If the dressing starts to peel, do not try to press it back down. Debris and bacteria can be trapped underneath. Call your home care nurse for a dressing change.

**Do not apply lotion, cream, or skin products** under or near the dressing.

**Do not cover the insertion site with tight clothing** that might rub or disturb the dressing.

---

## Bathing and Hygiene with a PICC

**Showering:** You can shower with proper protection (see above). Let the water flow away from the PICC arm rather than directly over it. After showering, check that the dressing is still secure and dry.

**Baths:** Avoid submerging the PICC arm in bathwater. You may bathe with the arm held out of the water, though showers are generally easier.

**Swimming:** Not permitted while the PICC is in place. Pool water, ocean water, and lake water all carry high bacterial contamination risk.

**Washing your hair:** This is fine as long as the PICC arm is protected and the dressing does not get wet.

---

## Activity and Lifestyle with a PICC

### What you CAN do with a PICC

- Walk, climb stairs, do gentle activities
- Drive (if your condition otherwise allows) — the PICC arm should not limit most driving
- Light household activities
- Return to most daily routines
- Travel (ask your care team about managing your PICC while traveling — extra supplies and scheduling of flushes across time zones may need planning)
- Sleep in any position comfortable to you

### What to AVOID with a PICC

**Heavy lifting and strenuous arm use:** Avoid lifting anything heavier than approximately 5–10 pounds (2–4 kg) with the PICC arm, or as instructed by your care team. Strenuous activity — including vigorous swimming, heavy gym work, rowing, or similar — should be avoided because it can cause the PICC to shift or cause increased clotting risk.

**Constrictive clothing or blood pressure cuffs on the PICC arm:** Do not allow blood pressure cuffs to be placed on the arm with the PICC. If you wear compression garments, ensure they do not cover or press on the PICC site. Remind any nurse or assistant taking your vitals: "Please take my blood pressure on the other arm."

**Reaching or stretching the arm behind the body:** Avoid movements like reaching behind your back with the PICC arm, as this can dislodge or damage the line.

**Contact sports:** Avoid activities where the PICC could be hit, pulled, or subjected to impact.

## What Normal Looks Like

After placement and for the duration of PICC use, some things are completely normal:

- A small amount of bruising near the insertion site in the first few days
- Mild tenderness at the insertion site in the first 24–48 hours
- The dressing may develop a small amount of moisture condensation on the inside — this is different from the dressing being wet from external water
- You may feel occasional mild awareness of the catheter in the arm — not pain, just awareness

## Warning Signs: When to Call Your Home Care Nurse

**Call your home infusion nurse or vascular access nurse line** (keep the number posted) if:

- **Dressing is loose, wet, lifting, or dirty** — needs prompt changing
- **Insertion site looks red, swollen, or has any discharge** — possible infection
- **The external length of the PICC has changed** — the line may have shifted in or out
- **You cannot flush the line** (significant resistance) — do not force it; call
- **Arm is more swollen, achy, or warm than usual** — possible blood clot
- **You see blood backing up inside the catheter tubing**
- **You have questions or are unsure about any aspect of your care**

**Go to the emergency room or call 911 if:**

- **Fever (≥38°C / 100.4°F) with shaking chills** — possible bloodstream infection; this is urgent
- **Significant arm swelling with pain** — possible DVT; this is urgent
- **Shortness of breath or chest pain** — call 911
- **The PICC line comes completely out** — keep the catheter, go to ER
- **Uncontrolled bleeding from the insertion site** — apply gentle pressure and go to ER

## Managing Your Infusions at Home

If you are receiving IV infusions at home (antibiotics, IV nutrition, other medications):

- **Follow the schedule exactly.** Skipping doses or taking them at very different times can compromise treatment.
- **Store medications as instructed.** Many IV medications require refrigeration. Take them out of the refrigerator and allow to reach room temperature for 30 minutes before infusion (unless instructed otherwise) — cold infusions can be uncomfortable.
- **Check for signs of contamination** before each use: Is the bag/cassette clear? Is the expiration date valid? Is the seal intact? If something looks wrong, call your pharmacy.
- **Keep a medication log** of each dose administered, including the date, time, and any symptoms.
- **Never share your medications** or allow anyone else to use your PICC.

---

## Follow-Up Care

You will need regular follow-up while your PICC is in place:

- **Dressing changes:** Every 7 days (or as scheduled), either by your home infusion nurse or at an outpatient clinic
- **Lab monitoring:** Many IV antibiotics and other medications require periodic blood tests to monitor drug levels, kidney function, and other parameters. Know your lab schedule.
- **PICC line assessment:** Your team will periodically assess the PICC for position, function, and signs of complications.
- **Treatment end date:** Know approximately when your IV course is expected to end. The PICC will be removed as soon as treatment is complete.

**Write down your follow-up appointments:**

| Date | Time | Location | Purpose |
|------|------|----------|---------|
| | | | Dressing change |
| | | | Lab draw |
| | | | MD/NP follow-up |

---

## PICC Removal

When your treatment is complete, your PICC will be removed. Removal is quick and simple:

- No anesthesia is needed
- The dressing is removed, and any securement is released
- The nurse gently and steadily pulls the catheter out over a few seconds
- You will feel pulling pressure — brief discomfort
- Gentle pressure is held at the site for a few minutes
- A small dressing is applied

After removal, a small bruise or firmness may be felt for a few days. Report any persistent swelling, redness, or drainage to your care team.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I drive with a PICC?**
Yes, in most cases. The PICC arm itself does not prevent driving. However, if your underlying condition or medications affect your ability to drive safely, follow your doctor's guidance on this separately.

**What if I wake up and the dressing is peeled off?**
Call your home care nurse immediately. Do not attempt to re-dress the site with non-sterile tape or supplies. A sterile dressing change is needed as soon as possible.

**What if I accidentally pull the line partially out?**
Do not push it back in. Keep the area clean, cover loosely with gauze if available, call your home infusion nurse, and go to a facility if directed. Bring the catheter with you.

**Can I work or go to school with a PICC?**
Many people do. Discuss your specific situation with your care team, particularly if your job involves heavy physical labor, exposure to water, or a high-infection-risk environment.

**How will I know when my PICC is no longer needed?**
Your physician will determine when your treatment course is complete based on your clinical progress, lab results, and the nature of your infection or condition. Your PICC will be removed as soon as it is no longer medically necessary.
