# Questions to Ask Your Vascular Access Team

Asking questions is one of the most powerful things you can do to stay safe and informed during IV therapy and catheter care. Research consistently shows that patients who ask questions and engage actively in their care have better outcomes.

This guide gives you organized, ready-to-use questions for every stage of your vascular access care — from the moment a catheter is recommended to the day it is removed.

> **You do not need to ask every question on this list.** Choose the ones that matter most to you. Bring this guide (or write your questions down) to appointments. There is no such thing as a question that is too basic or too detailed.

### Understanding the procedure itself
- "Can you walk me through exactly what will happen during the procedure, step by step?"
- "Will I be awake? Will I feel anything?"

### Practical preparation
- "Do I need to do anything to prepare? (Fasting, stopping medications, etc.)"

## Tips for Getting the Most from Medical Conversations

**Bring a support person.** A trusted family member or friend can help you remember information, think of additional questions, and provide emotional support. Two sets of ears are better than one.

**Write your questions down in advance.** It is easy to forget questions in the moment, especially when you are anxious, in pain, or distracted. Writing them down means nothing gets missed.

**Ask the most important questions first.** If your appointment time is limited, prioritize. You may not get through everything, but your most urgent concerns will be addressed.

**Take notes or ask if you can record the conversation.** Medical information can be overwhelming. Notes or a recording allow you to review what was said later.

**Ask for written instructions.** Verbal instructions are easily forgotten. Request written discharge instructions, care guides, or printed information sheets for anything important.

**Use the teach-back method.** After your nurse or doctor explains something, try to explain it back in your own words: "So what I understand is that I need to flush the line every morning with saline — is that right?" This confirms understanding on both sides.

**Involve your care team as a team.** Your vascular access nurse, infusion pharmacist, home infusion nurse, and physician all have different expertise. Some questions are best answered by specific team members:
- *Medication questions:* Your pharmacist or prescribing physician
- *Catheter care questions:* Your vascular access nurse or home infusion nurse
- *"What is this medication doing to my body?" questions:* Your physician or NP
- *Insurance and supply questions:* Your case manager or the home infusion coordinator
