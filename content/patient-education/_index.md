# Patient Education: Vascular Access

This section contains guides written for **patients, families, and caregivers** — not for clinical staff. Our goal is to help you understand what is happening with your IV or catheter, how to stay safe, and how to take an active role in your care.

Browse the guides below or use the search to find a specific topic. If you have questions, always ask your nurse or vascular access team — no question is too small.
