# IV Medications and Infusion Therapy Explained

Infusion therapy simply means delivering medication, fluids, or nutrition directly into your bloodstream through a vein. When oral medications will not work fast enough, cannot be absorbed properly, or would be harmful to the digestive system, IV therapy provides an effective and controlled alternative.

This guide explains the different types of infusions, what happens during a treatment session, how equipment like infusion pumps works, and what you can do to stay comfortable and safe.

## Why IV Instead of a Pill?

You might wonder why some medications must be given through a vein rather than taken by mouth. There are several reasons:

**Speed.** Medications injected into the bloodstream are absorbed immediately — in minutes. Oral medications must be absorbed through the gut, which takes 30–90 minutes. In urgent situations, speed is critical.

**Bioavailability.** Some drugs are broken down by stomach acid or the liver before they can reach effective concentrations in the blood. IV delivery bypasses this, allowing 100% of the medication to reach circulation.

**Controlled delivery.** An infusion pump delivers a precise, constant dose over a set time — something impossible to replicate with a pill.

**Patient cannot swallow.** Patients who are unconscious, severely nauseated, or have problems swallowing cannot take oral medications.

**Medications that would damage the gut.** Certain drugs (some antibiotics, cancer medications) would cause serious gastrointestinal side effects if given orally.

## Types of Infusion Therapy

### IV Fluids

The most basic infusion is IV fluids — solutions of water, salt (saline), sugar (dextrose), or electrolytes. These are used to:

- Treat or prevent dehydration
- Replace blood loss
- Maintain a safe, stable internal environment after surgery or illness
- Provide a carrier for other medications

Common IV fluids include Normal Saline (0.9% NaCl), Lactated Ringer's solution, and dextrose solutions. Your nurse may refer to "running fluids" or "a maintenance drip."

### IV Antibiotics

IV antibiotics are one of the most common reasons for both hospital and home infusion therapy. Some infections — particularly serious bacterial infections, bone infections (osteomyelitis), heart valve infections (endocarditis), or infections in immunocompromised patients — require antibiotics that are more powerful or better absorbed when given IV.

IV antibiotics are typically given over 30 minutes to several hours, once, twice, or three times daily depending on the drug. Treatment courses can last days to weeks. Many patients complete their IV antibiotic course at home through a home infusion program.

Common IV antibiotics include vancomycin, ceftriaxone, piperacillin-tazobactam (Pip-Tazo), ertapenem, cefepime, and daptomycin, among many others.

**What to expect:** Your first few doses of a new IV antibiotic are typically given in a monitored setting because rare but serious reactions (including anaphylaxis) can occur. Once a new antibiotic is established as being well-tolerated, it may be continued at home.

### IV Pain Medications

Certain pain medications — particularly opioids such as morphine, hydromorphone (Dilaudid), and fentanyl — may be given IV for acute or severe pain. They can be given as a single push dose, as a continuous infusion, or through a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump that allows you to self-administer small controlled doses when you feel pain.

**PCA pumps** have safety locks to prevent overdose — you can press the button as often as you need, but the pump will only deliver a dose within the pre-set time interval.

### IV Nutrition (Total Parenteral Nutrition / TPN)

When the digestive system cannot be used — due to bowel surgery, severe bowel disease, or other conditions — the body can still receive all necessary nutrients through a vein. This is called **total parenteral nutrition (TPN)** or sometimes **parenteral nutrition (PN)**.

TPN is a complex solution containing:
- Glucose (carbohydrates for energy)
- Amino acids (proteins for muscle and repair)
- Lipids (fats for energy and essential fatty acids)
- Electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus)
- Vitamins and trace minerals

TPN must be given through a central line (PICC or similar) because it is too concentrated for peripheral veins. It is typically given continuously over 12–24 hours per day, often managed at home for patients who require it long-term.

### Chemotherapy and Cancer Medications

Chemotherapy drugs are given IV to treat many types of cancer. Infusion durations vary enormously — from a 15-minute injection to 46-hour continuous infusions — depending on the specific drug and regimen.

**What to expect:** Chemotherapy infusions are usually given in oncology infusion centers. You will be connected to an infusion pump and monitored throughout. Some drugs require pre-medications (anti-nausea drugs, steroids, antihistamines) given before the main treatment begins, and you may need to remain for observation afterward.

Chemotherapy agents can be highly irritating or damaging if they infiltrate (leak out of) the vein — a serious complication called **extravasation**. This is one key reason why most chemotherapy is delivered through a PICC, port, or central line rather than a peripheral IV.

### Blood Transfusions and Blood Products

Transfusions deliver red blood cells, platelets, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), or other blood products directly into the bloodstream to:

- Treat significant blood loss (surgery, trauma, gastrointestinal bleeding)
- Correct severe anemia
- Treat bleeding disorders or low platelet counts

Blood products are given through an IV or central line, typically over 2–4 hours, with close monitoring for the first 15–30 minutes. Serious transfusion reactions are rare but require immediate nursing response.

**Tell your nurse** if you have had a transfusion reaction in the past, or if you have any concerns or questions about receiving blood products.

### Biologics and Immunotherapy

Biologic medications — drugs derived from living cells used to treat autoimmune diseases, cancer, inflammatory conditions, and more — are often given by IV infusion. Examples include infliximab (Remicade), rituximab, trastuzumab (Herceptin), and many others. These are typically given in specialty infusion centers on scheduled days, often monthly or every few weeks.

### Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG)

IVIG is a blood product containing concentrated antibodies used to treat immune deficiencies and certain autoimmune conditions. Infusions take several hours and are given in a clinical setting on a scheduled basis.

## How Infusion Pumps Work

Most IV medications are delivered using an **infusion pump** — an electronic device that precisely controls the rate at which fluid flows from an IV bag through tubing into your catheter.

**Why pumps matter:** Many IV medications are dangerous if given too fast or too slow. The pump ensures the exact programmed rate is maintained, and alarms alert the nurse if something changes (an empty bag, a blocked line, etc.).

**The pole:** The IV pump is usually mounted on a tall pole on wheels. Most pumps are designed so you can roll the pole alongside you when you get up to use the bathroom or walk the hallway. **Ask your nurse how to manage the pole before getting up for the first time.**

**Common pump alarms you might hear:**
- *"Air in line"* — a small air bubble has been detected. This usually does not mean air has entered your bloodstream — pumps detect extremely small amounts. Your nurse will clear the air and restart the infusion.
- *"Occlusion"* — the pump is detecting resistance. The tubing may be kinked or the catheter may be partially blocked. Your nurse will assess and resolve this.
- *"Low battery"* — the pump needs to be plugged back in. Alert your nurse.
- *"Infusion complete"* — the bag is empty. Do not disconnect anything yourself; call your nurse.

**What you can and cannot do yourself:**
- You can push the nurse call button and alert staff to any pump alarm.
- You can silence a beeping alarm by pressing the "silence" or "alarm off" button — but always tell your nurse afterward so they can address the cause.
- **Do not change the rate, bypass the pump, or disconnect tubing without your nurse's instruction.**

## What to Expect During an Infusion Session

### Before the infusion begins
- Your nurse will check your identification (name and date of birth) against the medication label — every time. This is not excessive caution; medication errors are a known patient safety risk.
- Your nurse will review any allergies on your chart.
- Vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, heart rate) may be taken before certain infusions (e.g., blood products, first-dose chemotherapy, biologics).
- The catheter will be flushed with saline to confirm it is working.

### During the infusion
- You can generally sit up, watch TV, read, use your phone, or sleep.
- You can usually move around — just be mindful of the tubing and pole.
- **Tell your nurse** if you feel anything unusual: burning, stinging, pain at the site, itching, difficulty breathing, chills, or just a general sense that something feels wrong.
- Some medications cause recognizable side effects during infusion — ask your nurse in advance what to expect from your specific treatment.

### After the infusion
- Your nurse will flush the catheter with saline (and possibly heparin) to clear the line of medication and prevent clotting.
- The line may be disconnected and capped if you are not receiving continuous fluids.
- Vital signs may be taken again.
- For some medications (particularly first doses, transfusions, or biologics), you may be asked to remain for 30–60 minutes of observation.

## Staying Comfortable During Infusions

**Temperature:** Some IV medications feel cold going in, particularly when infused quickly. Tell your nurse if you are feeling cold — warming the infusion bag slightly or slowing the rate may help.

**Pain or burning:** A small amount of coolness at the site is sometimes normal. But **any burning, stinging, or significant pain during an infusion should be reported immediately.** This can indicate the infusion is going outside the vein (infiltration/extravasation).

**Nausea:** Some medications cause nausea. Anti-nausea pre-medications can often be given before or during the infusion. Ask your care team if this is a known side effect of your treatment.

**Boredom/discomfort from sitting:** Infusions can take a long time. Bring something to occupy your time — a book, headphones, tablet. For long infusions in infusion centers, many facilities have recliner chairs; some allow you to bring a family member.

**Bathroom:** If you need to use the bathroom during an infusion, call your nurse before disconnecting anything. In most cases, your nurse will guide you on how to safely move with the pump pole.

## Home Infusion Therapy

Many patients complete IV antibiotic courses, receive TPN, or receive other infusions at home through a **home infusion program.** A specialized pharmacy prepares your medications and delivers them to you; a home infusion nurse visits your home to teach you how to manage the infusion.

Before you go home with an infusion device, your nurse will make sure you can:
- Identify your medication and understand its purpose
- Connect and disconnect the infusion safely (if applicable)
- Flush the catheter correctly
- Recognize and respond to pump alarms
- Identify signs of complications and know who to call

Do not hesitate to say "I'm not ready" or "I need more practice" before leaving the hospital. Going home confidently is the goal.

## Hazardous Drugs and Special Precautions

Some IV medications — particularly many chemotherapy agents — are classified as **hazardous drugs** because they are toxic to cells. Your nurses and pharmacists who prepare and handle these drugs wear special protective equipment (gloves, gowns, face protection).

**As a patient receiving hazardous drugs:**
- You do not need to wear special protective equipment during the infusion itself
- Your urine, stool, and other bodily fluids may contain traces of the drug for 48–72 hours after treatment — your nurse will provide specific instructions about precautions during this time (e.g., flushing the toilet twice, using disposable gloves when handling bodily fluids)
- Follow all specific instructions from your oncology or infusion team
