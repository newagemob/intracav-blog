# Subcutaneous Infusion (Hypodermoclysis): What to Expect

Most people are familiar with IV lines that go into veins. But for some patients — particularly those in palliative care, hospice, older adults with difficult venous access, or patients needing gentle hydration at home — there is another option: **subcutaneous infusion**, also called **hypodermoclysis**.

In subcutaneous infusion, fluids or medications are delivered **under the skin** (into the subcutaneous tissue — the layer of fat and connective tissue beneath the skin surface) rather than directly into a blood vessel. The body then absorbs the fluid or medication gradually from the tissue into circulation.

## Who Is Subcutaneous Infusion For?

Subcutaneous infusion is particularly useful when:

- **Venous access is difficult or impossible.** In older adults, patients with extensive prior IV use, or those with fragile veins, finding a usable vein is painful and often unsuccessful. Subcutaneous tissue is accessible almost anywhere on the body.
- **Long-term IV access (PICC, port, central line) is not appropriate.** When a patient's overall condition or goals of care make the burden of a central catheter unacceptable, subcutaneous access is far simpler.
- **Gentle hydration is needed at home or in hospice.** Subcutaneous fluid delivery can maintain comfort and prevent dehydration without the complexity of intravenous hydration.
- **Regular symptom-control medications are needed without repeated injections.** A small needle under the skin can stay in place for days, providing a route for pain medication, anti-nausea drugs, and other comfort medications without repeated needle sticks.
- **The patient or caregiver can manage at home.** Subcutaneous infusion setups are simple enough to be managed in home, hospice, or nursing home settings with basic training.

Common clinical situations where subcutaneous infusion is used:
- Palliative care and hospice — symptom management and comfort hydration
- Older adults with dehydration who have poor venous access
- Pediatric patients requiring hydration when IV access is difficult
- Post-surgical patients with nausea preventing adequate oral intake and difficult veins
- Patients on chronic subcutaneous medications (such as some chemotherapy agents, teriparatide, or biologic agents administered subcutaneously)

## What Can Be Given Subcutaneously?

Not all IV medications can be given subcutaneously — some would cause tissue irritation or damage, and some are absorbed too slowly or erratically this way. The following are commonly given via subcutaneous infusion:

### Fluids for hydration
- **Normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride)**
- **0.45% sodium chloride** (half-normal saline)
- **5% dextrose in water (D5W)** — used in some protocols
- With or without added electrolytes (potassium, magnesium) at low concentrations

Rates are slower than IV hydration (typically 60–120 mL/hour maximum at a single site), but adequate for maintenance hydration or gentle rehydration.

### Medications — commonly used
- **Morphine and hydromorphone** — for pain management
- **Haloperidol** — for nausea and agitation
- **Midazolam** — for anxiety and seizure control
- **Metoclopramide** — for nausea
- **Hyoscine butylbromide (buscopan)** — for secretion management
- **Dexamethasone** — for inflammation, nausea, and other indications
- **Furosemide** — for fluid management in some protocols

Your care team will confirm which medications are appropriate for subcutaneous delivery in your specific situation. Not all formulations of a given drug are suitable — concentration and pH matter.

### What cannot be given subcutaneously
- **Concentrated potassium** — causes tissue damage
- **Chemotherapy drugs** that vesicants (cause blistering/necrosis if outside a vein) — must be given IV
- **Blood products** — cannot be given subcutaneously
- **Medications that require rapid peak levels** — absorption is too slow
- Some antibiotics (limited by irritancy and required concentrations)

## The Equipment: What a Subcutaneous Infusion Setup Looks Like

A subcutaneous infusion requires minimal equipment:

**The needle or cannula:** A small, fine needle (often called a **butterfly needle** or **Teflon cannula**) is inserted at a shallow angle (typically 45 degrees) into subcutaneous tissue. The needle is very short — typically **24–27 gauge** (thinner than most standard IV needles). Some setups use a soft plastic cannula rather than a metal needle, which is more comfortable for extended use.

**Securing the device:** The needle or cannula is secured with a transparent dressing (similar to a PICC dressing), taped gently to keep it from moving.

**The tubing and pump:** Extension tubing connects the needle to a syringe driver (a small electronic device that delivers medication at a controlled rate), a portable infusion pump, or a gravity infusion set for fluids.

**Syringe drivers:** In palliative care, a **syringe driver** or **continuous subcutaneous infusion (CSCI) device** is commonly used to deliver one or more medications continuously over 24 hours from a small syringe. This allows multiple symptom-control medications to be mixed and given together around the clock.

## Where Is the Site?

Subcutaneous needles can be placed at multiple body locations. The most common sites:

| Site | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Anterior thigh | Excellent; comfortable; good absorption; recommended first-line |
| Abdomen | Very accessible; good absorption; avoid area around navel |
| Upper outer arm | Good for patients who are mobile; nurse or carer must reach it |
| Chest wall (subclavicular area) | Common in palliative care; allows patient freedom of movement |
| Back / flank | Option when other sites are limited |

### How long does a site last?
A single subcutaneous infusion site can typically remain in place for **48–72 hours** before being changed. Sites should be changed sooner if:
- Redness, swelling, or firmness develops at the site
- The patient reports increasing discomfort or a burning sensation
- Fluid is leaking back along the needle track
- The needle appears dislodged

Multiple sites can be used if continuous infusion is needed long-term, rotating between them to allow recovery.

## What the Procedure Feels Like

### Insertion
- A brief sting or sharp sensation as the needle goes in — similar to a blood draw but typically milder because the needle is finer and the angle is more superficial
- Most patients tolerate insertion well; topical anesthetic cream can be applied 45–60 minutes beforehand if desired

### During infusion
- Fluids infusing subcutaneously may cause a **noticeable lump** (swelling) at the infusion site — this is expected and is the fluid collecting in the subcutaneous tissue before being absorbed. It is soft and usually not painful.
- Mild warmth or fullness at the site — normal
- Faster infusion rates or more irritating solutions may cause discomfort — tell your nurse if the site becomes painful

### At the end of a session or site change
- Needle removal is quick and typically painless
- The small puncture closes immediately; a small adhesive bandage may be applied

## Site Care: What You Do at Home

If you are managing subcutaneous infusion at home (or your caregiver is managing it), site care is straightforward:

### Daily checks
- Inspect the site around the dressing each day: look for redness, swelling beyond the expected small lump of fluid, hardness, or warmth
- If the site looks inflamed, discolored, or feels painful, the site needs to be changed — call your nurse

### Keeping the site secure
- Avoid tension or pulling on the tubing; coil and tape excess tubing near the site
- When moving or repositioning, keep the syringe driver or pump at the same level as the site to avoid accidental needle movement
- Do not submerge the site in water (bathtub, swimming) — keep it covered and protected during showering with a waterproof cover if your nurse advises

### Site changes
- Sites are changed by your nurse or specifically trained caregiver every 48–72 hours or sooner if needed
- A new site is selected with each change, rotating systematically around available sites

## Advantages and Limitations

### Advantages over IV access
- **No need for venous access** — avoids the difficulty, pain, and risk of repeated IV insertions
- **Simpler to maintain** — no flushing protocols, no locked needleless connectors, no dressing changes as complex as PICC care
- **Lower infection risk** — subcutaneous tissue infection risk is much lower than bloodstream infection risk from a central catheter
- **Manageable at home** — patients, families, and community nurses can learn to manage subcutaneous infusion with basic training
- **Comfortable** — many patients find subcutaneous needles less obtrusive than IV lines

### Limitations compared to IV access
- **Slower absorption** — subcutaneous medication absorption is slower and less predictable than direct IV delivery; not suitable when rapid drug effects are required
- **Volume limits** — maximum infusion rates are lower than IV (typically 1 mL/minute maximum; 60–120 mL/hour for hydration)
- **Not all medications are compatible** — more restricted formulary than IV
- **Site reactions** — some medications cause more local irritation than others; the site may swell, become uncomfortable, or need more frequent changes
- **Not for emergencies** — subcutaneous infusion cannot replace IV access in acute emergencies

## Subcutaneous Infusion in Palliative and Hospice Care

Subcutaneous infusion is particularly well-suited to the palliative and hospice setting, where:

- **Comfort, not cure, is the goal.** The simplicity and comfort of subcutaneous access aligns with the goals of care.
- **Home care is preferred.** Most people prefer to die at home or in a familiar setting. Subcutaneous infusion allows medications for pain, breathlessness, nausea, and restlessness to be given continuously at home without hospitalization.
- **Venous access may be failing.** As patients near the end of life, peripheral veins often become impossible to cannulate. Subcutaneous access remains available.
- **Round-the-clock symptom control.** A continuous subcutaneous infusion (CSCI) via a syringe driver provides steady medication levels throughout the day and night, preventing peaks and troughs in symptom control.

If you are in a palliative or hospice setting and have questions about whether subcutaneous infusion is appropriate for your situation, ask your palliative care nurse or physician.

## Talking with Your Care Team

Questions worth asking:
- Is subcutaneous infusion appropriate for my situation?
- Which medications or fluids would be given this way?
- How will the site be monitored and by whom?
- Who do I call if the site looks wrong or the infusion seems to stop?
- Can I or my caregiver learn to change the site?
- How does this fit with my overall goals of care?
