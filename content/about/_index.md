## About the Founders

### Mike Stern, MD — CMO & President

Dr. Michael Stern is the President and Chief Medical Officer of Intracav, bringing a rare blend of engineering expertise and medical leadership to the forefront of healthcare innovation. With degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering, Dr. Stern initially worked briefly as an engineer. However, it was through volunteering on an ambulance that he discovered his true passion for medicine, prompting him to shift his career path toward patient care.

After earning his medical degree, he pursued a surgical residency, followed by fellowships in Adult and Pediatric Surgical Critical Care and Surgical Device Design at the University of Michigan's CS Mott Hospital. Over the years, Dr. Stern has held key roles as a trauma surgeon, ICU director, and vascular access medical director.

His leadership includes pioneering efforts to empower nursing teams to be first in state to place CICC lines at his previous role and championing vascular access best practices at his current Detroit hospital. A dedicated member of the Association for Vascular Access, he has earned accolades, including the prestigious Impact Award, for his contributions to the field.

### Dennis Woo, RN — CEO

Dennis Woo is an Interventional Vascular Access Specialist RN with 5yrs in Pediatrics/Adult ER. After placing thousands of IVs in the ER, transitioning into vascular access specialty was a huge eye opener to how much he DIDN'T know about the invasive procedures he was performing.

His passion for educating both clinicians and patients bled into the social media space. Although risking competitive edge, (by providing up-to-date information and opening a dialogue to discourse about all things vascular access) he hopes to democratize the skills and knowledge through social media in hopes to improve patient care at scale.

After placing hundreds of thousands of central lines in the hospital which included prominent public figures like Carol Danvers, Bruce Banner, and Clark Kent, he still has nothing worth listening to.

### Blaine Pantano, NP — COO

Blaine is a dedicated Nurse Practitioner with over a decade of experience in the healthcare field, marked by a commitment to providing exceptional patient care and advancing healthcare access. Over the past ten years, he has cultivated a diverse and robust career, beginning with seven years of intensive care bedside nursing.

During this time, he honed his skills in various ICU settings, including cardiac, cardiovascular surgery, general surgery, and medical ICUs. Transitioning from bedside nursing, Blaine spent five years specializing in interventional vascular access procedures, where his expertise significantly improved patient outcomes and streamlined care processes.

This period of specialization laid a strong foundation for his current role in pulmonary critical care. Today, he serves as a Nurse Practitioner on an abdominal transplant unit, as well as in the cardiac and medical ICUs. Throughout his career, he has been driven by a profound aspiration: to ensure that others do not face the same hurdles in accessing healthcare information that he once did.

This passion fuels his dedication to empowering colleagues and patients alike, fostering an environment where knowledge is shared freely and effectively to enhance patient care. He continues to be an advocate for comprehensive healthcare education, aspiring to create pathways for future healthcare professionals to succeed and innovate.

### Isaiah Wright — CTO

Isaiah is a Coast Guard veteran and commercial diver with a deep commitment to advancing healthcare technology. His diverse background in software development includes the creation of machine learning models for the Department of Homeland Security's navigation systems and natural language processing (NLP) models specifically designed for communications during diving operations.

Through his extensive experience working offshore, he has gained invaluable insights into the critical need for efficient and accurate data collection and analysis. This firsthand knowledge has motivated him to join Intracav, where he is dedicated to enhancing the availability of standardized vascular access knowledge.

He is passionate about building innovative tools that empower healthcare providers to deliver superior patient care. His technical acumen, combined with a profound understanding of the challenges faced by medical professionals, drives his commitment to developing solutions that improve outcomes and streamline processes in the healthcare sector.
