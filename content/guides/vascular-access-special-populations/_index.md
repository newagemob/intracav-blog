# Vascular Access in Special Populations: Clinical Reference

Standard vascular access approaches must be adapted for populations with anatomically, physiologically, or clinically distinct characteristics. Pediatric patients have smaller, more fragile veins and unique developmental considerations. Neonates require specialized devices for umbilical access. Oncology patients need durable central access for chemotherapy while managing heightened infection risk. Hemodialysis patients depend on a hierarchy of access modalities with distinct nursing management. Critical care patients require simultaneous hemodynamic monitoring access alongside therapeutic infusion.

This guide covers the most clinically significant special population scenarios for vascular access, with device selection guidance, technique considerations, and population-specific risk management.

## Pediatric Vascular Access

### Unique Challenges

Vascular access in children is challenging for multiple reasons:
- **Smaller vessels**: Pediatric veins are smaller in caliber, shorter, and less stable during cannulation
- **Limited sites**: Fewer suitable sites compared to adults; scalp veins available only in neonates and young infants
- **Movement and cooperation**: Children, especially toddlers and preschoolers, may not cooperate with procedures; restraint and distraction techniques are essential
- **Parental anxiety**: Parents are present and emotionally engaged; family-centered care principles require explicit parent communication and involvement
- **Skin fragility**: Neonatal and infant skin is more susceptible to MARSI from adhesive products; lower threshold for skin injury with standard dressings

### Site Selection by Age

| Age | Preferred PIV Sites |
|---|---|
| Neonate/infant | Dorsum of hand, forefoot, scalp veins (anterior temporal, frontal, occipital), antecubital |
| Toddler (1–3 yr) | Dorsum of hand, forearm, antecubital; avoid feet if ambulatory |
| Preschool (3–6 yr) | Forearm, antecubital, dorsum of hand |
| School-age+ | Forearm, antecubital, dorsum of hand (same as adult); avoid dominant hand if possible |

**Scalp vein IVs in neonates and infants:**
- Used when extremity access is unavailable or has failed
- Standard 24G butterfly or 24G over-needle catheter
- Shave minimal hair if needed (inform parents first)
- No tourniquet — occlude vein with fingertip
- Note: cannot be used for blood transfusions or hypertonic solutions
- **Caution**: Temporal artery is superficial and adjacent to temporal vein — confirm vein (non-pulsatile, no blanching on infusion) before taping

### Pain Management in Pediatric IV Access

Pain management is a clinical and ethical obligation during pediatric IV procedures:

- **Topical anesthetics**: EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics; lidocaine 2.5% + prilocaine 2.5%) applied 60 minutes before access; LMX-4 (4% liposomal lidocaine) applied 30 minutes before access
- **Vapocoolant sprays**: Instant numbing; effective for procedures requiring <30 seconds (e.g., PIV insertion); available as ethyl chloride or -20°C device
- **Sucrose pacifier (neonates)**: 24% oral sucrose 2 minutes before procedure; validated analgesic effect in neonates for minor procedures
- **Non-pharmacological techniques**: Distraction (electronic devices, music, bubble blowing), parental presence and holding (kangaroo/comfort positioning), guided imagery in older children, child life specialist involvement

### Pediatric PICC

Pediatric PICC indications are similar to adult but with age-specific device sizing. Key considerations:
- Single-lumen PICC preferred to minimize thrombosis risk
- PICC size by patient weight: approximately 1.9 Fr (28G) for neonates/small infants, 2.6 Fr (23G) for infants, 3–4 Fr for older children
- Tip location: lower SVC/CAJ — same CEVAD principles as adult; must adjust for pediatric anatomy
- Post-procedure CXR or intraprocedural ECG guidance required for tip confirmation

## Neonatal/NICU Vascular Access

The NICU patient population presents the most technically demanding and highest-stakes vascular access challenges in clinical practice. Premature neonates have fragile, microscopic vessels, immature skin, and physiologic vulnerabilities that amplify the consequences of every catheter complication.

### Peripheral IV in the NICU

- Target veins: hand dorsum, forefoot dorsum, scalp veins
- Catheter size: 24G or 26G (preterm); 22G–24G (term)
- Stabilization: minimal tape/adhesive; avoid circumferential wrapping (compartment syndrome risk); splint joint above site to reduce catheter movement
- Infusion rate monitoring: even small volumes of extravasation are clinically significant in neonates; site assessment minimum q1–2h
- Limitation: osmolarity tolerance for peripheral access is lower in neonates due to smaller vessel caliber and thinner vessel walls

### Umbilical Venous Catheter (UVC)

The UVC is inserted through the umbilical vein, which remains patent and accessible in the first 3–5 days of life.

**Indications:**
- Emergency vascular access in the delivery room (resuscitation)
- Central access for hyperosmolar infusions, TPN, blood products, inotropes
- When peripheral IV access is unavailable or failing

**Tip position:** Lower IVC, at the junction of the IVC and right atrium (above the diaphragm and hepatic veins). A tip in the hepatic circulation risks hepatic necrosis from concentrated infusates; confirm position by CXR.

**Dwell time:** Maximum **7–14 days** per most NICU protocols (infection risk increases significantly after 14 days).

### Umbilical Arterial Catheter (UAC)

The UAC accesses the umbilical artery (paired vessels in the umbilical cord) for continuous blood pressure monitoring and arterial blood gas sampling.

**Tip position:** Either "high" (T6–T9, above the celiac axis) or "low" (L3–L5, below the renal and mesenteric arteries). High position is more commonly used.

**Dwell time:** Maximum 5–7 days in most NICU protocols.

### NICU PICC (Long-Line)

NICU PICCs (often called "long-lines") are placed via peripheral veins (basilic, saphenous, great saphenous, scalp) and advanced to the SVC/CAJ.

**NICU PICC indications:** PN >5 days, IV access needed beyond the first week of life, home IV therapy in stable infants being discharged.

**Complications:** NICU PICC-associated CLABSI is a critical quality metric; NICU CLABSI rates are tracked by NHSN and benchmarked by birth weight strata. PICC-associated cardiac tamponade (from tip in the right atrium) is a rare but catastrophic neonatal complication — confirm tip is not in the heart.

## Oncology Vascular Access

Cancer patients represent one of the most complex vascular access populations, with competing considerations of high-volume chemotherapy, infection risk from immunosuppression, the need for durable access for long-term or intermittent therapy, and the importance of patient comfort and autonomy.

### Port vs. PICC for Chemotherapy

| Feature | Implanted Port | PICC |
|---|---|---|
| Dwell | Years (the device; needle changed per access) | Weeks to months |
| Body image | No external device between accesses | External device visible/palpable |
| Infection risk | Low (completely subcutaneous) | Moderate (external exit site) |
| Maintenance between accesses | Monthly flush (inactive periods) | Weekly dressing + flush |
| Access | Requires Huber needle (ANTT, some discomfort) | External hub; easier access |
| Best for | Long-term/intermittent chemotherapy, long-term PN, repeated IV access | Short- to medium-term infusion, OPAT, bridge access |
| INS/AVAR preference | Port preferred for >3 months intermittent therapy | PICC appropriate for continuous or short-term therapy |

**ONS/ASCO recommendations:** Implanted ports are preferred for most long-term and intermittent chemotherapy protocols. PICCs are appropriate for continuous infusions (e.g., continuous 5-FU), OPAT, and patients who are not candidates for port placement.

### Port Access in the Oncology Setting

- Use non-coring Huber needle only
- Dwell time of a single Huber needle access: typically 7 days per INS 2021 (change if longer therapy course or if dressing becomes compromised)
- CHG-impregnated dressing or TSM during active port access
- ANTT strict for every port access in immunocompromised patients
- Confirm blood return before initiating vesicant or vesicant-adjacent agents

### Vesicant Chemotherapy

All vesicant chemotherapy agents **must be administered through a confirmed, functional central venous access device**. Pre-administration assessment must confirm: brisk blood return, easy flushing, no swelling or pain at infusion site. For peripheral administration of irritants (not vesicants), document patient/provider shared decision-making and use a new PIV placed within 24 hours.

## Hemodialysis Vascular Access

The hierarchy of hemodialysis vascular access — established by KDOQI guidelines and reinforced by "Fistula First" initiatives — prioritizes the safest and most durable access option for each patient.

### AV Fistula (AVF): The Gold Standard

An AV fistula is a direct surgical anastomosis between an artery and vein, creating a high-flow venous conduit. The radiocephalic (wrist) fistula is first choice; brachiocephalic and brachiobasilic are alternatives.

- **Maturation time**: 6–12 weeks minimum before first cannulation (arterial blood flow causes vein to "mature" — enlarge and thicken)
- **Advantages**: Lowest infection rate, longest patency, most cost-effective long-term
- **Nursing assessment**: Auscultate for bruit (continuous thrill); palpate for thrill; absence suggests thrombosis or stenosis — notify access team

### AV Graft (AVG)

An AV graft uses synthetic material (PTFE) to connect an artery and vein. Can be cannulated earlier (2–4 weeks) than an AVF.

- Higher infection rate than AVF; graft material does not have antimicrobial properties
- Access sites must be rotated (rope-ladder or area cannulation); avoid buttonhole technique in grafts

### Tunneled Dialysis Catheter (TDC)

Used as bridge access or when AVF/AVG is not feasible. Carries the highest infection risk of any dialysis access modality.

- Heparin or citrate lock between dialysis sessions
- Exit site care: CHG-impregnated dressing; assess at each dialysis session
- KDOQI target: <10% of dialysis patients on TDC as their primary access

## Critical Care Vascular Access

ICU patients require simultaneous therapeutic infusion access and hemodynamic monitoring access, often through multiple concurrent devices.

### Arterial Lines

Arterial catheters (A-lines) provide continuous blood pressure monitoring and facilitate frequent arterial blood gas sampling.

**Site selection:**
- **Radial artery (wrist)**: First choice; collateral circulation via ulnar artery; Allen test or Doppler confirmation of collateral flow before insertion
- **Femoral artery**: High flow, easily accessible; higher infection risk than radial; reserve for radial failure or hemodynamic instability requiring larger-bore access
- **Brachial artery**: Avoid — end artery (no collateral circulation); hand ischemia risk if thrombosed
- **Axillary artery**: Alternative for prolonged hemodynamic monitoring

**A-line maintenance:**
- Continuous pressurized flush (typically heparin 1 unit/mL, 1–3 mL/h) to maintain line patency
- Change pressure bag and tubing per institutional protocol (typically 96–120 hours)
- Dressing change q48–72h; assess insertion site at every dressing change

### Central Venous Access in the ICU

ICU CVCs typically serve multiple functions: CVP monitoring, multiple simultaneous infusions (vasopressors, sedation, antibiotics), and blood sampling. Key points:

- Subclavian or IJ preferred over femoral per CDC guidelines
- Ultrasound guidance standard for IJ; increasingly used for subclavian (infraclavicular)
- Multilumen catheters acceptable for ICU patients requiring simultaneous incompatible infusions; minimize lumens to clinical need
- CLABSI prevention bundle compliance is especially critical in ICU given patient vulnerability and higher device utilization

---

## Geriatric Considerations

- **Fragile veins**: Elderly skin is thin; veins are more susceptible to mechanical trauma and less resilient to phlebitis. Use smallest acceptable catheter gauge; avoid antecubital fossa if patient ambulatory
- **MARSI risk**: Adhesive products must be selected carefully; use silicone-based or low-tack products for fragile skin; skin barrier products beneath securement devices
- **Anticoagulation**: Elderly patients on anticoagulation have increased bleeding risk from catheter sites; monitor insertion sites more frequently
- **Cognitive impairment**: Patients with dementia may dislodge catheters; catheter securement is especially important; consider clinical appropriateness of central access in patients who will not tolerate it

---

## Immunocompromised Patients

Patients with neutropenia (ANC <500/μL), active immunosuppression, or functional asplenia are at dramatically increased CLABSI risk. Management principles:

- Strict adherence to insertion AND maintenance bundles — no shortcuts
- CHG-impregnated dressings standard (if not contraindicated)
- Daily catheter necessity review — remove as soon as no longer required
- Antimicrobial lock therapy (ALT) may be appropriate for high-risk patients with recurrent CLABSI per IDSA guidance
- Lower threshold for blood cultures and catheter removal at first sign of fever or hemodynamic instability
