# Oncology Vascular Access: Port Placement, Chemotherapy Access Requirements, and Immunocompromised Considerations

Cancer patients represent one of the most vascular access-intensive patient populations in clinical practice. Chemotherapy protocols require reliable, long-term central access for vesicant and irritant infusions. Immunosuppression from both the disease and treatment profoundly alters CLABSI risk. The trajectory of cancer treatment — from diagnosis through treatment, remission monitoring, and sometimes palliative care — imposes changing vascular access requirements that demand thoughtful device selection at each stage.

## Device Selection Across the Cancer Treatment Continuum

Oncology vascular access decisions are driven by:
- **Chemotherapy regimen:** Vesicant vs non-vesicant; bolus vs continuous infusion; number of cycles
- **Treatment duration:** Short-course (weeks) vs long-term (months to years)
- **Treatment frequency:** Weekly vs every-3-weeks vs continuous
- **Ancillary access needs:** Blood draws, contrast CT, blood products, nutritional support
- **Patient factors:** Body habitus, bilateral axillary lymph node dissection, thrombosis history, patient preference, lifestyle

### Device Selection Matrix for Oncology Patients

| Scenario | Preferred Device | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Curative intent, 4–6 cycles, frequent access | Implanted port | Most durable, lowest infection rate during remission; accessed only during chemotherapy |
| Metastatic disease, continuous infusion chemo (FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, capecitabine pump) | Implanted port or tunneled CVC | Long-term; tunneled CVC allows continuous 24/7 access without needle |
| Inpatient consolidation chemotherapy (AML) | PICC or tunneled CVC | Prolonged hospital-based therapy |
| Short-course, non-vesicant regimen with good peripheral access | PICC | Less invasive; removes without procedure after therapy |
| Stem cell transplant (BMT) recipient | Multi-lumen tunneled CVC (Hickman) | Multiple simultaneous access needs; prolonged hospitalization |
| Palliative care, comfort-focused infusions | PIV or PICC | Minimize invasiveness |

## Implanted Port: The Standard for Long-Term Chemotherapy Access

### Why Ports Are Preferred in Oncology

Implanted ports have the lowest CLABSI risk of all CVADs during the intervals between treatments (when the port is not accessed). This makes them ideal for cancer patients who receive treatment in cycles — port is accessed only on treatment days; between cycles, it sits beneath the skin with no external components and no infection risk from hub manipulations.

**Evidence:** A meta-analysis by Maki et al. and multiple observational studies consistently show implanted ports have CLABSI rates of 0.1–0.3 per 1,000 catheter-days — substantially lower than PICC (1.0–2.0/1,000 catheter-days) in outpatient oncology populations.

### Power-Injectable Ports: Why They Matter in Oncology

Cancer patients undergo serial CT imaging for staging and treatment response assessment. CT contrast requires high-flow injection (typically 2–5 mL/sec, up to 325 psi pressure limits).

**Standard ports cannot withstand CT contrast injection pressures** — they are rated for gravity/pump flow only. A standard port or standard PICC subjected to power injection may:
- Fracture the catheter
- Disconnect the port-catheter junction
- Damage the port septum

**Power-injectable ports** (Power Port, Bard PowerPort, C.R. Bard PORT-A-CATH Power P.A.S.) are rated for power injection:
- Pressure rating: typically ≤325 psi
- Flow rate: ≤5 mL/sec
- **Identification:** Triangular or ribbed palpation profile; marked with "CT" on the reservoir or "POWER" on the catheter hub; some institutions use purple Huber needles for power ports

**Clinical imperative:** Verify port type before contrast injection. If power-injectable status cannot be confirmed, do not use the port for CT contrast — use a large-bore PIV (18G or larger) in the antecubital fossa instead.

### Port Access in the Oncology Setting

**Huber needle selection for oncology:**
- 19G or 20G Huber needle for standard chemotherapy access
- 22G for blood sampling or low-flow access
- 90-degree (right-angle) Huber: standard for most ports accessed for infusion
- Straight Huber: occasionally used for short-duration access

**Continuous-access protocols (chemo pumps):** Patients receiving continuous 5-FU infusions via ambulatory pump (FOLFOX, FOLFIRI protocols) will have a Huber needle dwelling in the port for the entire infusion cycle (typically 46–96 hours). The needle dwell increases CLABSI risk slightly versus intermittent access.

**Huber needle dwell time:** Current evidence recommends Huber needles for continuous infusions be changed every 7 days. Some institutions change every access cycle for chemotherapy patients.

## PICC Lines in Oncology

### When PICC Is Appropriate for Oncology Patients

PICCs are appropriate for oncology patients when:
- Short-term therapy (weeks, not months)
- Inpatient or high-frequency outpatient access where needle access each visit is impractical
- Patient preference against port surgical procedure
- Rapid treatment initiation needed before port placement

**PICC limitations in oncology:**
- Requires daily maintenance (flushing) and weekly dressing changes
- External component increases CLABSI risk compared to port during between-treatment intervals
- DVT risk: 2–3× higher in cancer patients than non-cancer patients with PICC (cancer is the strongest independent risk factor for PICC-associated DVT)
- Cannot be used for power injection of CT contrast unless a **power-injectable PICC** is placed (identified by purple-capped hub and "power" marking)

### Bilateral Axillary/Supraclavicular Lymph Node Dissection

**Contraindication to ipsilateral PICC:** Patients who have undergone axillary lymph node dissection (e.g., breast cancer with axillary dissection) should NOT receive a PICC in the ipsilateral arm. Rationale: lymphedema risk in the arm with disrupted lymphatic drainage is increased by any instrumentation of the vasculature, and swelling can compromise the arm further.

**Bilateral axillary dissection:** When bilateral lymph node dissection has been performed, discuss alternative central access (port, tunneled CVC) with the oncology team — PICC in either arm requires careful risk-benefit discussion.

## Central Access Requirements for Chemotherapy Agents

### Mandatory Central Access: All Vesicant Chemotherapy

**Vesicant chemotherapy agents require central venous access** for all therapeutic doses. Extravasation of vesicant chemotherapy causes tissue necrosis, permanent functional impairment, and potentially the need for surgical debridement.

**Chemotherapy vesicants requiring central access:**
- All anthracyclines (doxorubicin, epirubicin, daunorubicin, idarubicin)
- All vinca alkaloids (vincristine, vinblastine, vinorelbine)
- Taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel)
- Cisplatin (at concentrations >0.4 mg/mL)
- Mechlorethamine, carmustine, streptozocin
- Mitomycin C, dactinomycin

See [Vesicant Administration Safety](/guides/infusion-therapy-safety/vesicant-administration-safety/) for complete vesicant protocol.

### Non-Vesicant Chemotherapy: Peripheral Administration

Some non-vesicant chemotherapy agents can be administered peripherally in select circumstances with close monitoring. This decision requires:
- Confirmation that the specific drug and concentration are classified as non-vesicant or irritant (not vesicant)
- Patient has adequate peripheral venous access
- Patient is able to report pain or burning immediately
- Monitoring every 30 minutes throughout infusion
- Antidote immediately available if the agent's classification changes

**Institutional policy governs** which non-vesicant agents may be administered peripherally in your facility's chemotherapy protocol.

## CLABSI Prevention in Immunocompromised Oncology Patients

### Why Oncology Patients Are at Higher CLABSI Risk

Cancer patients have multiple CLABSI risk factors that compound standard catheter-related infection risk:

1. **Neutropenia:** Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <500 cells/μL markedly impairs bacterial clearance; even low-level catheter colonization can cause life-threatening bacteremia in a neutropenic patient
2. **Mucosal barrier disruption:** Chemotherapy-induced mucositis disrupts the gut barrier, creating bacteremia risk from translocation of gut flora — some CLABSI cases are secondary to gut-origin organisms
3. **Frequent catheter access:** Chemotherapy protocols involve frequent hub manipulations (blood draws, pre-medications, chemotherapy administration, post-hydration)
4. **Steroid use:** Corticosteroids (dexamethasone as antiemetic; prednisone in lymphoma protocols) impair innate immunity
5. **Central venous malignancy:** Tumor invasion or compression near catheter tip can impair blood flow and create local infection niche

### Enhanced CLABSI Prevention in Neutropenic Patients

Standard CLABSI maintenance bundle (scrub-the-hub, CHG dressings, daily bathing) is the baseline. For neutropenic oncology patients, additional measures are warranted:

**Antimicrobial lock therapy (ALT):** IDSA guidelines support ALT for salvage of infected CVADs in select cases and for prophylaxis in selected high-risk patients (long-term home TPN, pediatric oncology). Common ALT solutions: ethanol 70%, taurolidine-citrate, vancomycin (for gram-positive prophylaxis).

**Minimum access principle:** Minimize the number of catheter manipulations per day. Consolidate blood draws and medication administration to reduce hub access events.

**Passive disinfection caps:** Alcohol-impregnated connector caps (Curos, SwabCap) on all catheter hubs between access events provide passive 70% IPA disinfection — particularly valuable in oncology settings with frequent access.

**CLABSI threshold for port vs PICC:** Among ambulatory oncology patients receiving intermittent chemotherapy, implanted ports consistently demonstrate CLABSI rates 3–10× lower than PICCs during between-treatment intervals when the port is not accessed. For patients with curative-intent treatment expected to exceed 3 months, port placement is the superior infection-prevention strategy.

## Thrombosis Risk in Oncology Patients with CVADs

Cancer is the strongest independent risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Cancer patients with PICCs have PICC-associated DVT rates of 5–10% (symptomatic) and up to 50% (subclinical), versus 1–5% in non-cancer patients.

### Catheter-Associated Thrombosis Prevention in Oncology

- **Catheter-to-vein ratio:** ≤45% catheter-to-vein ratio (highest modifiable risk factor) — use single-lumen where clinically feasible; select the catheter with the smallest outer diameter that meets clinical needs
- **Optimal tip placement:** CAJ position (not mid-SVC) reduces risk — blood flow at CAJ provides maximum hemodilution
- **Upper arm basilic vein first:** Basilic vein (largest, most direct) preferred over cephalic or brachial
- **Anticoagulation for cancer-associated VTE:** LMWH is preferred over warfarin for cancer-associated DVT treatment; DOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban) are increasingly recommended per ISTH and CHEST guidelines
- **Catheter removal vs anticoagulation:** If PICC-associated DVT develops in a cancer patient, the decision to remove the catheter vs. anticoagulate with catheter in place depends on ongoing need for access, DVT severity, and clinical context

## Thrombocytopenia and Vascular Access Procedures

Chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100,000/μL) is common in oncology patients. Vascular access procedures carry bleeding risk in thrombocytopenic patients.

### Platelet Count Thresholds for Vascular Access Procedures

| Procedure | Platelet Threshold |
|---|---|
| PIV placement | No threshold specified (clinical judgment) |
| PICC placement | Generally acceptable ≥50,000/μL (consider ≥80,000 in active bleeding states) |
| Port access (Huber needle) | Generally acceptable at any platelet count (minimal trauma) |
| Tunneled CVC insertion | ≥50,000/μL (operator preference varies) |
| Port placement (surgical) | Consult with hematology/oncology team; typically ≥50,000 |

**Note:** These are general guidance thresholds, not hard cutoffs. Clinical context, bleeding history, and platelet function all factor into the decision.
