# Hemodialysis Vascular Access: AVF, AVG, and Tunneled Dialysis Catheter Clinical Guide

Hemodialysis vascular access represents a unique and specialized domain within vascular access practice. Unlike most IV therapy access — which uses central venous devices to deliver drugs or fluids — hemodialysis access must sustain high-volume extracorporeal blood flow (typically 300–500 mL/min) across three or more sessions per week, for years to decades. The vascular access itself becomes a critical long-term asset for the ESRD patient, and its preservation is a clinical and ethical priority.

## The Hemodialysis Access Hierarchy: Fistula First

KDOQI (Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative) guidelines and the Fistula First Breakthrough Initiative establish a priority hierarchy for hemodialysis access:

**1. Arteriovenous Fistula (AVF) — Preferred**
**2. Arteriovenous Graft (AVG) — Second choice**
**3. Tunneled Dialysis Catheter (TDC) — Bridge or last resort only**

This hierarchy is based on outcome data: AVFs have the longest functional survival, lowest infection rates, and lowest mortality associated with dialysis access. Tunneled catheters carry the highest mortality risk among ESRD patients — catheter-dependent dialysis is associated with substantially worse survival outcomes.

**Clinical implication:** Every ESRD patient on a tunneled catheter should have a plan and timeline for transition to AVF or AVG. Catheter dependence should never be considered a permanent solution unless no surgical options exist.

## Arteriovenous Fistula (AVF)

### What Is an AVF?

A surgical anastomosis between a peripheral artery and adjacent vein, creating a high-flow arteriovenous connection. Blood enters the vein at arterial pressure, causing the vein to dilate, thicken, and "mature" (develop the wall strength and flow capacity required for needle cannulation).

**Common AVF configurations:**
- **Radiocephalic (Brescia-Cimino) fistula:** Radial artery to cephalic vein at the wrist — the original and most durable AVF configuration; created first when feasible
- **Brachiocephalic fistula:** Brachial artery to cephalic vein at the antecubital fossa — larger, easier to mature than radiocephalic; used when wrist veins are inadequate
- **Brachiobasilic fistula:** Brachial artery to basilic vein — requires transposition of the basilic vein (a two-stage surgical procedure); created when cephalic vein is unusable

### AVF Maturation: The "Rule of 6s"

An AVF requires maturation time before it can sustain repeated cannulation. The classic maturation target is the **Rule of 6s**:
- Blood flow ≥600 mL/min
- Vein diameter ≥6 mm
- Depth ≤6 mm beneath skin
- Length ≥6 cm of usable segment

**Time to maturation:** Most AVFs require 6–12 weeks after surgical creation before first use. Some AVFs (particularly radiocephalic in older or diabetic patients) require longer; some fail to mature at all (maturation failure rate 20–60% for radiocephalic in some populations).

**Failure to mature:** AVFs that do not achieve Rule of 6 criteria within 3–4 months should be evaluated by interventional radiology (fistulogram) to identify correctable causes (accessory veins causing outflow competition, anastomotic stenosis, central venous stenosis).

### AVF Physical Assessment Before Cannulation

Before each dialysis session, assess the AVF:

1. **Thrill:** Palpate the fistula segment — a continuous vibratory sensation (thrill) indicates patent, high-flow access. A pulsatile (non-continuous) pulse without thrill suggests outflow stenosis — refer for evaluation.
2. **Bruit:** Auscultate with stethoscope — a continuous bruit is expected; a high-pitched or discontinuous bruit may indicate stenosis.
3. **Site inspection:** Look for signs of infection, aneurysm (excessively dilated segments), hematoma, skin breakdown over aneurysmal sites.
4. **Blood flow:** If measurable dialysis blood flow falls >25% from baseline, evaluate for stenosis.

### AVF Cannulation Techniques

**Rope-ladder technique:** Cannulation sites rotate systematically along the entire length of the fistula segment, moving up and down like a ladder. Each session uses a new site. Allows the vessel wall to heal between uses. Standard recommended technique.

**Buttonhole technique (constant-site cannulation):** The same two sites are used for every session. With repeated needle insertion at the same site at the same angle and depth, a fibrous "tunnel" develops through subcutaneous tissue into the vessel — subsequent needle insertion follows this established track. Advantages: less pain after track establishment, less skill required for each cannulation. Disadvantages: buttonhole sites are a significant infection risk (skin colonization in the fibrous tract → bacteremia); requires scrupulous skin antisepsis; MRSA bacteremia has been associated with buttonhole technique. **Not recommended as first-line** at most centers due to infection risk.

**Cannulation needle gauge:** Standard dialysis needles are 15G or 16G (AV fistula needles are large-bore by IV standards — required to achieve 300–500 mL/min blood flow).

## Arteriovenous Graft (AVG)

### What Is an AVG?

A synthetic graft (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, ePTFE) or biological conduit surgically interposed between artery and vein, creating a bridge for dialysis cannulation. The graft surface can be cannulated directly.

**Common AVG configurations:**
- Forearm loop graft (radial artery to antecubital vein)
- Upper arm straight graft (brachial artery to axillary vein)
- Thigh graft (superficial femoral artery to femoral vein) — used when upper extremity exhausted

### AVG vs AVF: Key Differences

| Feature | AVF | AVG |
|---|---|---|
| Durability | 10–15+ years (if uncomplicated) | 3–5 years |
| Time to first use | 6–12 weeks | 2–3 weeks (earlier cannulation possible) |
| Infection risk | Lowest | Moderate (graft material is foreign body) |
| Thrombosis risk | Lower | Higher (40–50% graft thrombosis in first year) |
| Intervention rate | Lower | Higher (stenosis, thrombosis require frequent intervention) |
| Preferred by guidelines | First choice | Second choice |

### AVG Cannulation

Similar to AVF cannulation technique (rope-ladder vs buttonhole). The graft can be cannulated as soon as it is patent (typically 2–3 weeks post-surgery, allowing edema resolution and tissue incorporation). No maturation period is required — the graft material is immediately cannulable.

**Cannulation of a graft that is too edematous or too fresh** (within the first 2 weeks) risks hematoma formation and graft failure.

## Tunneled Dialysis Catheter (TDC)

### Indications for TDC

TDC is a central venous catheter designed specifically for high-flow hemodialysis. Indications:

- **Bridge access:** While awaiting AVF maturation or surgical AVF/AVG creation in a patient newly starting dialysis
- **Failed AVF/AVG:** When all surgical access options are exhausted
- **Acute renal failure:** Short-term dialysis when recovery is anticipated
- **Patient preference or inability to undergo surgery:** Rare; must be carefully documented

### TDC Anatomy and Features

- **Size:** Typically 12–14 Fr dual-lumen catheter (compared to 7–8 Fr for most CVCs); large bore required for dialysis blood flow
- **Tunneling:** TDC has a subcutaneous tunnel from insertion site to exit site, with a Dacron cuff at the midpoint — same as Hickman-type tunneled CVCs; cuff provides infection barrier and anchoring after tissue ingrowth (4–6 weeks)
- **Tip location:** IVC-RA junction (for femoral insertion) or RA/SVC-RA junction (for IJ or subclavian insertion). Right atrial position is required for adequate blood flow
- **Dual-lumen configuration:** Arterial port (draws blood out to dialyzer) and venous port (returns blood from dialyzer) — arterial port tip typically 2 cm proximal to venous port

### TDC Insertion Sites

**Right internal jugular (preferred):** Provides the most direct path to the right atrium; lowest rate of central venous stenosis; lowest catheter dysfunction rate.

**Left internal jugular:** Longer path, requires more catheter length; higher catheter dysfunction rate.

**Subclavian:** Higher rate of central venous stenosis — **avoid in ESRD patients** (central venous stenosis at the subclavian → SVC junction can be limb-threatening for a future ipsilateral AVF).

**Femoral:** Reserved for when all jugular/subclavian options are exhausted; highest infection rate; patient cannot ambulate effectively; used as bridge only.

### TDC Complications and CLABSI Risk

**TDC carries the highest CLABSI rate of all hemodialysis access options:**
- Rate: 2–7 per 1,000 catheter-days (compared to 0.5–1.0/1,000 for tunneled non-dialysis CVCs)
- ESRD patients have baseline immune dysfunction (uremia impairs neutrophil function)
- Dialysis sessions involve mandatory hub manipulation 3× per week (connecting/disconnecting dialysis tubing)
- Heparin locks in TDC create an ideal environment for biofilm formation

**Organisms:** *S. aureus* (including MRSA) and *Staphylococcus epidermidis* are the most common TDC CLABSI pathogens. Gram-negative bacteremia from TDC indicates possible hematogenous seeding from another source.

**Prevention:**
- Antimicrobial lock therapy (ALT): taurolidine-citrate or gentamicin-citrate locks in TDC are the highest-evidence intervention for catheter-related bacteremia prevention in dialysis patients (KDOQI 2019; Cochrane meta-analysis 2014)
- **Mupirocin nasal ointment:** Applies to dialysis catheters — nasal *S. aureus* carriage is a major source of TDC CLABSI; mupirocin nasal ointment 3× weekly reduces *S. aureus* CLABSI in dialysis patients
- **Exit site antisepsis:** Povidone-iodine or CHG applied to exit site at each dialysis session
- **Passive disinfection caps:** Alcohol-impregnated caps on arterial and venous ports between sessions

### TDC Lock Solutions

Standard TDC locking between dialysis sessions uses **heparin** (concentration per institutional protocol — typically 1,000 units/mL or 5,000 units/mL, filling only the catheter dead space — DO NOT flush through with full-volume heparin, as systemic heparinization will occur).

**Alternatives when heparin is contraindicated (HIT):**
- Citrate 4% (anticoagulant, antimicrobial — evidence-supported alternative to heparin in dialysis catheters)
- Normal saline (minimal anti-thrombotic effect; not recommended for TDC as sole lock)

## Vessel Preservation in CKD and ESRD: The Critical Clinical Imperative

The most clinically important contribution a vascular access clinician makes to a CKD/ESRD patient's long-term outcomes may be **preserving the forearm and antecubital veins for future AVF creation.**

### What Not to Do in CKD/ESRD Patients

**Do NOT place PICCs or midline catheters in the following veins in a CKD/ESRD patient without explicit nephrology consultation:**
- Cephalic vein (forearm or upper arm)
- Basilic vein
- Brachial vein

These are the primary AVF creation veins. Damage from PICC insertion, phlebitis, or thrombosis can permanently eliminate a potential AVF site.

**Do NOT place subclavian CVCs** in ESRD patients — subclavian venous stenosis eliminates the ability to create an ipsilateral AVF.

**Do NOT draw blood or place PIVs in the antecubital fossa or cephalic vein** of a CKD patient if an AVF is planned in that arm.

### Safe Vascular Access Strategies for CKD Patients

- Use the non-dominant arm for all non-dialysis IV access whenever possible
- Use hand veins (dorsal) rather than forearm/antecubital veins
- For central access: use right internal jugular CVC or PICC — NOT subclavian
- Document CKD status in clinical records and alert team to vessel preservation requirements
- Consult nephrology or vascular access team before placing any central venous device in a CKD patient (GFR <30 mL/min)

## Transition from TDC to AVF/AVG

When an AVF or AVG matures, the transition from TDC to native/prosthetic access is a critical clinical event:

1. **Assessment of access maturation:** Confirm Rule of 6s criteria are met (for AVF); confirm graft is mature and edema has resolved (for AVG)
2. **Trial cannulation:** First attempt at needle cannulation — should be performed by an experienced dialysis nurse; document outcome
3. **Catheter removal:** Once AVF/AVG is successfully supporting full dialysis sessions, remove TDC as soon as practical. Every day a TDC remains in place in a patient with functional AVF/AVG represents unnecessary CLABSI risk.
4. **Catheter removal procedure:** Tunneled catheters require Dacron cuff removal — a bedside or minor procedural suite procedure involving blunt dissection over the cuff site under local anesthesia
