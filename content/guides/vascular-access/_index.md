# Vascular Access: The Complete Clinical Reference

Vascular access is the foundation of modern clinical care. In the United States, an estimated **300 million peripheral IV catheters** are placed annually, and more than **5 million central vascular access devices (CVADs)** are inserted each year in acute care settings alone. For clinicians inserting, managing, or troubleshooting vascular access devices, evidence-based practice grounded in current standards is essential for both patient safety and regulatory compliance.

This guide covers the complete spectrum: device types and selection principles, relevant clinical standards, complication prevention, documentation requirements, and quality metrics. Use the navigation links to explore focused satellite guides on each topic.

## What Is Vascular Access?

**Vascular access** is the establishment of a route into the vascular system — most commonly the venous system — for the purpose of delivering medications, fluids, blood products, or nutritional support, or for monitoring hemodynamic parameters.

The term encompasses a broad spectrum of devices and approaches:

- **Peripheral venous access**: insertion of a catheter into a superficial peripheral vein, typically in the arm or hand
- **Midline catheter access**: insertion via a peripheral vein with the catheter tip remaining in the peripheral venous system (axillary or subclavian vein, below the thorax)
- **Central venous access**: insertion via a peripheral or direct central approach, with the catheter tip positioned in the central venous system (lower SVC or cavoatrial junction)
- **Specialized access**: intraosseous, arterial, neuraxial, subcutaneous, and umbilical catheter access

The term **vascular access device (VAD)** refers to any catheter, cannula, or needle used to access the vascular system. **Central vascular access device (CVAD)** specifically denotes any device with its tip in the central venous system.

## The Vascular Access Device Spectrum

Choosing the right VAD for the right patient and therapy is among the most consequential clinical decisions in infusion therapy. The current clinical standards establish the guiding principle: **use the least invasive device that meets the full clinical need for the prescribed duration of therapy.**

| Device | Insertion Site | Tip Location | Typical Dwell | Primary Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Peripheral IV (PIV) | Peripheral vein (hand, arm) | Peripheral vein | 72–96h | Short-term medications, fluids |
| Midline catheter | Peripheral vein (upper arm) | Axillary or basilic vein | 1–4 weeks | Moderate-term therapy, non-vesicant |
| PICC Line | Peripheral vein (upper arm) | Lower SVC / cavoatrial junction | Weeks to months | IV antibiotics, chemo, TPN, long-term therapy |
| Non-tunneled CVC | IJ, subclavian, or femoral vein | Lower SVC | Days to weeks | ICU monitoring, urgent central access |
| Tunneled CVC | Central vein (surgically tunneled) | Lower SVC | Months to years | Home infusion, oncology, long-term TPN |
| Implanted Port | Central vein (surgically implanted) | Lower SVC | Years | Intermittent chemotherapy, long-term IV |
| Hemodialysis Catheter (tunneled) | IJ or femoral vein | Right atrium/SVC | Months | Hemodialysis bridge or chronic dialysis |
| Intraosseous (IO) | Bone marrow cavity | Intraosseous space | <24h | Emergency access when IV unavailable |
| Arterial Line | Radial or femoral artery | Arterial system | Days | Hemodynamic monitoring, ABG sampling |
| Umbilical Catheter (UVC/UAC) | Umbilical vessels | IVC (UVC), aorta (UAC) | 5–14 days | Neonatal critical care |

## Evidence-Based Device Selection Principles

The **Vessel Health and Preservation (VHP)** framework, supported by supported by multiple health system studies, establishes a systematic approach to device selection that protects venous capital while meeting therapeutic goals.

### The Four VHP Questions

1. **What is the intended therapy?** — Osmolarity, pH, vesicant potential, infusion rate, and duration
2. **How long will access be needed?** — Days (PIV/midline), weeks (PICC), months to years (tunneled, port)
3. **What are the patient's vascular characteristics?** — Vessel quality, DIVA score, arm/shoulder history, renal status
4. **What is the patient's clinical context?** — Acuity, setting (ICU vs ambulatory), patient preference

### Osmolarity and pH Thresholds

 provides the following guidance on osmolarity:
- **<600 mOsm/L**: may be administered peripherally
- **≥600 mOsm/L**: strongly consider central access
- **>900 mOsm/L** (e.g., TPN, >10% dextrose, highly concentrated potassium): central access required

Medications with pH <5 or >9 are associated with significantly higher phlebitis rates via peripheral access. These include vancomycin (pH 3.9–5.0 at certain concentrations), acyclovir, amphotericin B, and phenytoin.

### The DIVA Score for Difficult IV Access

The **DIVA (Difficult Intravenous Access)** score predicts likelihood of failed peripheral IV placement and should guide early escalation to ultrasound-guided or midline/PICC access:

- **DIVA 0–1**: Standard peripheral IV approach
- **DIVA 2–3**: Consider ultrasound guidance for PIV
- **DIVA ≥4**: Strong consideration for midline or PICC

Key DIVA risk factors: history of difficult access, no visible veins, no palpable veins in antecubital fossa, history of IV drug use, obesity, sickle cell disease.

## Clinical Standards and Guidelines

### IDSA Guidelines (2009, updated)

The **Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)** published clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of intravascular catheter-related infection. These guidelines inform the diagnostic criteria, treatment pathways, and prevention strategies for CLABSI and CRBSI.

### CDC Intravascular Catheter Guidelines (2011, 2023 update)

The **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)** guidelines for prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections are the backbone of CLABSI prevention programs. They form the evidence base for the insertion and maintenance bundles now standard across US healthcare.

### Joint Commission NPSG 07.04.01

The **Joint Commission's National Patient Safety Goal 07.04.01** requires organizations to implement evidence-based practices to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections. Compliance is assessed during TJC surveys and requires documented insertion and maintenance bundle adherence.

### CMS Conditions of Participation

CMS includes HAI prevention (including CLABSI) in its Conditions of Participation for hospitals and long-term care facilities. CLABSI rates are publicly reported via Hospital Compare, creating accountability pressure and reputational risk.

## Overview of Catheter Complications

Vascular access devices carry measurable risk. Understanding complication incidence, risk factors, and prevention approaches is foundational to safe practice. The major complication categories are:

**Infectious:**
- CLABSI (central line-associated bloodstream infection): 30,000+ events/year in US hospitals; mean cost ~$48,000; attributable mortality 12–25%
- CABSI (catheter-associated bloodstream infection): broader category including non-ICU settings

**Thrombotic:**
- Upper extremity DVT (UEDVT): 1–5% incidence per PICC dwell
- Intraluminal thrombosis and fibrin sheath: contributes to occlusion in 10–35% of CVADs

**Mechanical:**
- Phlebitis (chemical, mechanical, bacterial): most common complication of peripheral IV; VIP scale grades 0–5
- Infiltration/extravasation: PIV infiltration in 20–70% of peripheral lines; vesicant extravasation rare but severe
- Air embolism: prevention is paramount during CVAD insertion and removal
- Catheter malposition: primary (at insertion) or secondary (migration during dwell)

**Skin:**
- Medical adhesive-related skin injury (MARSI): estimated 1.5 million events per year; often underreported

See [Catheter Complications: Recognition and Management](/guides/catheter-complications/) and [CLABSI Prevention Framework](/guides/clabsi-prevention/) for full coverage.

## Documentation Requirements

Vascular access documentation is a regulatory requirement and a key defense in adverse event review.  specifies minimum documentation elements:

**Insertion documentation** must include:
- Date, time, and clinical indication
- Device type, gauge, lumen count, brand
- Insertion site (vein, laterality, position)
- Number of attempts and any difficulty
- Tip position confirmation method (CXR, ECG) and result
- Inserter name and credentials
- Consent documentation reference

**Ongoing assessment** (each shift or per policy) must document:
- Site appearance (redness, swelling, drainage, pain)
- Device integrity (securement, dressing condition)
- Patent function (flushes, aspirates)
- Continued clinical indication

**Device removal** must document:
- Date, time, and reason for removal
- Catheter integrity on removal
- Tip length verification (for CVADs)
- Complication assessment at time of removal

See [Vascular Access Documentation Requirements](/guides/vascular-access/vascular-access-documentation-requirements/) for the complete guide.

## Quality Metrics for Vascular Access

High-performing vascular access programs track metrics across four domains:

| Domain | Key Metric | Target Benchmark |
|---|---|---|
| Infection | CLABSI rate (per 1,000 catheter-days) | ≤1.0 (ICU); ≤0.5 (non-ICU); zero |
| Insertion Quality | First-stick success rate | ≥90% for PIV; ≥95% for PICC |
| Device Appropriateness | Inappropriate PICC rate | <10% of placements |
| Dwell Time | Median PICC dwell time | Varies by indication; minimize unnecessary days |
| Safety | Bundle compliance rate | ≥95% insertion and maintenance bundle |
| Competency | Staff credentialing completion | 100% of inserters credentialed |

## The Vascular Access Team (VAT) Model

Evidence strongly supports the use of specialized vascular access teams to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs. Studies consistently demonstrate that VAT programs achieve:

- **Reduced CLABSI rates**: 40–70% reduction in institutions with dedicated VATs
- **Higher first-stick success**: VAT inserters achieve >90% first-stick success vs 60–70% for general nursing
- **Fewer inappropriate PICC placements**: VAT-led programs show 15–30% reduction in inappropriate use
- **Cost savings**: ROI of $1M+ per year in large institutions when accounting for prevented CLABSI events

See the full [Vascular Access Team Models guide](/guides/vascular-access-team-models/) for building, measuring, and governing a VAT program.
