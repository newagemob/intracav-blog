# Evidence-Based Vascular Access Device Selection: Clinical Decision Framework

The choice of vascular access device is not a trivial clinical decision. Inappropriate device selection — using a central device when a peripheral approach would suffice, or using a peripheral device for therapy requiring central access — carries real patient harm risks. Vascular access device selection requires systematic clinical reasoning grounded in evidence-based standards.

This guide covers the key frameworks and decision tools for evidence-based VAD selection: the Vessel Health and Preservation (VHP) approach, the DIVA score, osmolarity and pH thresholds, and the MAGIC appropriateness criteria.

## The Clinical Decision Problem

Consider: a patient with a new diagnosis of osteomyelitis is admitted for 6 weeks of IV cefazolin. The hospitalist orders a PICC "because it's long-term antibiotics." Should a PICC be placed?

The answer requires systematic assessment:
- Does the antibiotic require central access? (Osmolarity, pH, vesicant potential)
- Is there adequate peripheral venous access for a midline?
- Is oral transition an option? (Some organisms/patient situations allow IV-to-PO step-down)
- What is the patient's renal status? (ESRD or CKD 3–5 = avoid arm PICC)
- Does the patient have a prior DVT history or lymphedema in target arm?

This kind of structured assessment is what evidence-based device selection demands.

##  Core Principle

The foundational device selection principle in current clinical standards:

> **"Use the least invasive vascular access device that meets the full clinical needs of the patient for the prescribed duration of therapy."**

This principle establishes a hierarchy of invasiveness: peripheral (PIV) < midline < PICC < non-tunneled CVC < tunneled CVC or port. Each step up the hierarchy introduces additional risk (infection, thrombosis, procedural complications). Central access should only be used when clinically necessary.

## The Vessel Health and Preservation (VHP) Framework

The **Vessel Health and Preservation (VHP)** framework — developed and promoted by CVAA, AVAR, and vascular access researchers — is a systematic approach to device selection that prioritizes long-term venous capital alongside immediate clinical needs.

**The VHP concept:** Every patient has a finite supply of functional veins. Repeated peripheral IV failures, phlebitis events, and inappropriate PICC placements in the arms of patients with CKD consume this resource and may ultimately compromise future dialysis access creation. VHP takes a patient lifetime perspective.

**VHP Assessment Questions:**

1. What is the intended therapy? (osmolarity, pH, vesicant potential, rate, duration)
2. How long will IV access be needed? (days = PIV; weeks = midline/PICC; months-years = tunneled/port)
3. What is the patient's current venous status? (DIVA score, prior failed IV access, prior PICC or CVC history, AV fistula/graft status)
4. What is the patient's clinical context? (setting, acuity, patient preference, discharge plan)
5. Are there contraindications to specific access sites? (mastectomy, lymphedema, renal disease)

## The DIVA Score: Predicting Difficult IV Access

The **DIVA (Difficult Intravenous Access)** score is a validated clinical tool that predicts likelihood of failed standard peripheral IV placement. It guides decision-making about when to proceed directly to ultrasound-guided PIV, midline, or PICC.

**DIVA scoring criteria (Egan et al.):**

| Criterion | Score |
|---|---|
| History of difficult IV access | 1 |
| No visible veins in antecubital fossa | 1 |
| No palpable veins in antecubital fossa | 1 |
| Prior or current IV drug use | 2 |

**Score interpretation:**
- **0–1**: Standard PIV approach; low probability of failure
- **2–3**: Consider ultrasound guidance for PIV or escalation to midline
- **≥4**: High probability of failed standard PIV; escalate to US-guided PIV, midline, or PICC consultation

## Osmolarity and pH Decision Thresholds

Infusate osmolarity and pH are the primary pharmacologic drivers of device selection for medication-related access needs.

**Osmolarity thresholds :**
- <600 mOsm/L: peripheral IV acceptable for standard dwell
- 600–900 mOsm/L: central access strongly preferred; peripheral midline may be acceptable for short duration with close monitoring
- >900 mOsm/L: central access required

**pH thresholds:**
- pH 5–9: generally peripheral-compatible
- pH <5 or >9: high phlebitis risk peripherally; central access recommended

**Common high-osmolarity medications requiring central access:**
- Total parenteral nutrition (TPN): typically >1,500–2,000 mOsm/L
- Concentrated potassium chloride (>40 mEq/L)
- >10% dextrose solutions
- Mannitol 20%
- Some concentrated antibiotic formulations

## The MAGIC Criteria: PICC Appropriateness

The **Michigan Appropriateness Guide for Intravenous Catheters (MAGIC)**, developed by Chopra et al. (2015, *Ann Intern Med*) through a RAND/UCLA consensus process, provides evidence-based appropriateness criteria for PICC placement across clinical scenarios.

**Key MAGIC findings:**

PICCs are rated **appropriate** for:
- IV therapy ≥5 days with central access drug requirements
- Therapy requiring central access due to osmolarity/pH/vesicant properties
- Patients with documented inadequate peripheral venous access and need for IV therapy

PICCs are rated **inappropriate** for:
- Short-course IV antibiotics (≤5 days) in patients with adequate peripheral access and oral bioavailability
- IV access in ESRD patients without consent from nephrology regarding vessel preservation
- Placement as "convenience" when peripheral IV would suffice

Studies applying MAGIC criteria have found **20–40% inappropriate PICC placement rates** in institutions without formal appropriateness review. VAT-mediated consultation reduces inappropriate placement by 15–30%.

## Decision Algorithm Summary

```
STEP 1: What does the therapy require?
   → Osmolarity <600 mOsm/L AND duration <5 days → PIV
   → Osmolarity <900 mOsm/L AND duration 1–4 weeks → Midline
   → Osmolarity >900 mOsm/L OR vesicant OR duration >2 weeks → Central access

STEP 2: Which central device is appropriate?
   → Expected duration weeks–months → PICC (if not ESRD/CKD 3–5)
   → Urgent central access in ICU → Non-tunneled CVC
   → Intermittent therapy for >3 months → Port
   → Chronic home therapy → Tunneled CVC or port

STEP 3: Does the patient have any access site contraindications?
   → ESRD / CKD 3–5 → Avoid arm PICC; consult nephrology
   → AV fistula arm → Never place PICC or PIV in fistula arm
   → Lymphedema / mastectomy → Avoid ipsilateral arm
   → Prior arm DVT → Caution; imaging may be warranted

STEP 4: What is the patient's DIVA score?
   → DIVA ≥3 → US-guided PIV or escalate to midline/PICC
```
