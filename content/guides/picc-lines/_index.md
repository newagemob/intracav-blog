# PICC Lines: The Complete Clinical Reference

The **peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC)** is the most widely used central venous access device in hospitalized patients, representing approximately 40% of all CVADs placed in US acute care settings. A PICC offers the safety advantages of peripheral insertion — reducing the risk of immediate complications like pneumothorax and arterial puncture — while delivering the therapeutic flexibility of central venous access.

This guide covers the complete clinical scope: what a PICC is, who needs one, how it is inserted, how the tip position is verified, how it is maintained, what complications to anticipate, and how to remove it safely. Use the satellite guides linked throughout for deeper dives into each component.

## What Is a PICC Line?

A PICC is a **long, flexible catheter** inserted through a peripheral vein in the upper arm — typically the **basilic, brachial, or cephalic vein** — and advanced until the catheter tip rests in the **lower third of the superior vena cava (SVC) at or near the cavoatrial junction (CAJ)**. Because the tip terminates in the central venous system, a PICC is classified as a CVAD and is subject to central line management standards.

**Key distinguishing features:**
- Inserted peripherally (no thoracic puncture, no risk of pneumothorax at insertion)
- Central tip position — allows infusion of vesicants, hyperosmolar solutions, and concentrated medications
- Dwell time: weeks to months (substantially longer than midline catheters)
- Placed by trained nurses, advanced practice providers, and physicians using ultrasound guidance

**PICC vs. Midline vs. Non-tunneled CVC:**

| Feature | PICC | Midline | Non-tunneled CVC |
|---|---|---|---|
| Insertion site | Upper arm peripheral vein | Upper arm peripheral vein | IJ, subclavian, or femoral vein |
| Tip location | Lower SVC/CAJ | Axillary or subclavian vein | Lower SVC |
| Central access? | Yes | No | Yes |
| Dwell time | Weeks to months | 1–4 weeks | Days to 2 weeks |
| Vesicants | Yes (central tip) | No (peripheral tip) | Yes |
| TPN compatible | Yes | <900 mOsm/L only | Yes |
| Insertion risk | Low (US-guided, no thoracic puncture) | Low | Higher (pneumothorax, arterial injury) |

## PICC Indications

PICC placement is indicated when a patient requires **central venous access for a duration that justifies the risks and costs** of a PICC over a peripheral IV or midline, and when the clinical setting and patient characteristics support PICC use.

**Appropriate PICC indications include:**

- IV antibiotics requiring ≥5–7 days of central access (e.g., endocarditis, osteomyelitis, prolonged pneumonia treatment)
- Systemic chemotherapy with vesicant agents or protocols requiring central access
- Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with osmolarity >900 mOsm/L
- Continuous infusions of vasoactive medications, concentrated electrolytes, or other agents incompatible with peripheral access
- Multiple concurrent IV therapies requiring multi-lumen access
- Frequent blood draws where peripheral sampling is inadequate or traumatic
- IV therapy expected to extend beyond the patient's current hospitalization (discharge planning consideration)

**When PICC is NOT the appropriate choice:**

- Short-course IV therapy (<5 days) where a peripheral IV or midline would suffice
- End-stage renal disease (ESRD) or CKD stage 3–5 patients — PICC use in the upper extremity compromises future AV fistula creation (vessel preservation protocol)
- Bacteremia/fungemia — a new PICC should not be placed until bacteremia is cleared; existing PICCs in bacteremia require expedited removal evaluation
- Patients with known or suspected PICC-associated DVT in the target limb

The **Michigan Appropriateness Guide for Intravenous Catheters (MAGIC)** — a consensus-derived framework — provides detailed appropriateness criteria for PICC use and is strongly recommended as an institutional standard (Chopra et al., 2015).

## PICC Types and Device Selection

### Single vs. Multi-Lumen

INS 2021 Standards recommend using the **minimum number of lumens necessary** to meet the clinical care plan. Each lumen represents an additional infection and thrombosis risk. Single-lumen PICCs are preferred for most single-therapy indications. Multi-lumen (double or triple) PICCs are appropriate for patients requiring simultaneous incompatible infusions or frequent blood draws alongside infusion therapy.

### Power-Injectable vs. Standard

**Power-injectable PICCs** are rated for high-pressure contrast injection (typically up to 325 psi, 5 mL/sec), enabling CT contrast administration through the PICC. These devices are increasingly the standard due to flexibility in diagnostic imaging. They must be confirmed power-injectable on CXR or the device registry before use with power injector.

### Valved vs. Open-Ended

- **Pressure-activated safety valve (PASV) / Groshong-type valve**: Closed-ended PICC that reduces blood reflux into the catheter lumen, potentially reducing thrombotic occlusion. No heparin lock required per manufacturer — saline lock acceptable.
- **Open-ended**: Standard design; requires positive-pressure flushing and heparin or saline lock per institutional protocol.

### Anti-Thrombogenic and Antimicrobial Coatings

Various PICCs incorporate heparin coating, chlorhexidine/silver, or other antimicrobial coatings. The evidence for antimicrobial-coated PICCs reducing CLABSI in average-risk patients is mixed. Per IDSA/CDC guidance, antimicrobial catheters are recommended when the CLABSI rate remains elevated despite adherence to the standard prevention bundle.

## Patient Assessment for PICC Candidacy

Before PICC placement, a structured assessment should be completed:

1. **Vascular assessment**: Ultrasound assessment of target veins; document vein diameter (minimum 3–4 mm for standard PICC), compressibility (rule out existing DVT), depth, and quality
2. **DIVA score**: Quantifies peripheral IV difficulty; supports decision to proceed with PICC vs. attempting peripheral IV or midline
3. **Arm/shoulder assessment**: Contraindications to upper arm PICC include ipsilateral mastectomy with lymphedema, AV fistula in the same arm, previous shoulder/clavicle injury, known axillary/subclavian stenosis
4. **Renal function**: For CKD Stage 3+ (GFR <60) or ESRD, consult nephrology or renal team before placing PICC — vessel preservation is critical for future dialysis access
5. **Coagulation status**: PICCs can be placed with INR up to 3.0 in most institutions; check institutional threshold and anticoagulation protocol

## PICC Insertion: Technique Overview

PICC insertion in contemporary practice uses **ultrasound-guided modified Seldinger technique (MST)** under **maximal sterile barrier (MSB)** precautions. Key steps:

1. **Patient positioning**: Supine, arm abducted at 90°, head turned away (reduces IJ malposition)
2. **Maximal sterile barrier**: Sterile gown, gloves, mask/cap, and large sterile drape over patient
3. **Site selection**: Basilic vein is preferred (largest, straightest path to central circulation); brachial or cephalic if basilic unavailable or sub-threshold in size
4. **Vein access**: Real-time ultrasound, 21G micropuncture needle, cannulate vein, thread 0.018" guidewire
5. **PICC advancement**: Dilator placed, PICC advanced over wire; external length measured pre-procedure to estimated tip at CAJ
6. **Intraprocedural tip confirmation**: ECG-based guidance (Sherlock 3CG, MIRUS system, Nautilus) — P-wave amplitude increases as tip approaches SA node, optimal position at 70–85% of maximum P-wave; OR advance to estimated length and confirm via post-procedure CXR
7. **Securement and dressing**: Sutureless securement device (StatLock type) + CHG-impregnated transparent semi-permeable membrane (TSM) dressing

See [PICC Insertion Technique](/guides/picc-lines/picc-insertion-technique/) for the step-by-step procedural guide.

## PICC Tip Position: CEVAD Standards

Correct tip position is essential for PICC function and safety. An incorrectly positioned PICC tip causes:
- Increased thrombosis risk (peripheral tip position)
- Arrhythmias (tip too deep, in RA or RV)
- Inadequate medication dilution (peripheral position for central-access drugs)
- Vascular injury (tip impinging on vessel wall)

### The CEVAD Position Statement

The **Consensus Document on the Optimal Tip Location of Central Venous Access Devices (CEVAD)** defines the preferred tip location as the **lower third of the SVC** at or near the **cavoatrial junction (CAJ)** — the point at which the SVC meets the right atrium.

**Acceptable positions**: Lower SVC, distal to the azygous vein takeoff, above the right atrial shadow on CXR.

**Unacceptable positions requiring repositioning**:
- Internal jugular vein malposition
- Axillary vein malposition
- Contralateral subclavian vein
- Too deep: intracardiac (RA, RV)
- Too short: mid-SVC or more proximal

### Tip Confirmation Methods

1. **Intraprocedural ECG guidance** (Sherlock 3CG, MIRUS, Nautilus): Real-time P-wave morphology changes as tip approaches SA node; optimal position defined by P-wave peak criteria. Allows tip confirmation without post-procedure CXR. Validated accuracy: 95–98% for correct position.
2. **Chest X-ray**: Post-procedure CXR remains the most widely used confirmation method. Radiologist or trained clinician interprets tip position relative to carina, right mainstem bronchus, and cardiac silhouette.
3. **Fluoroscopy**: Gold standard; typically used in IR or hybrid OR settings, not at bedside.

See [PICC Tip Position and CEVAD Standards](/guides/picc-lines/picc-tip-position-verification/) for the full guide.

## PICC Maintenance Protocols

### Dressing Management

- **Transparent semi-permeable membrane (TSM) dressing** with CHG-impregnated disc or pad: Change every 7 days, or immediately if wet, soiled, or loosened
- **Gauze and tape**: Change every 48 hours, or immediately if wet, soiled, or loosened; use only when patient has TSM intolerance (fragile skin, CHG allergy)
- **Securement device**: Change with each dressing change; assess for skin injury beneath securement at every change

### Flushing and Locking

- **SASH protocol**: Saline (10 mL) → Administration → Saline (10 mL) → Heparin lock (10 units/mL) or saline lock
- **Technique**: Pulsatile push-pause motion; maintain positive pressure on final flush to prevent blood reflux
- **Frequency**: Flush each lumen every 8–24 hours when not in active use (per device and institutional protocol)

### Hub Disinfection

At every catheter access event: scrub the needleless connector hub with **70% isopropyl alcohol or CHG-alcohol wipe** for **≥15 seconds**, then allow to **air dry** before accessing. This is among the highest-leverage maintenance bundle behaviors for preventing intraluminal contamination.

### Administration Set Changes

Per INS 2021:
- Continuous infusion sets: change no more frequently than every 96 hours (every 4 days), unless clinically indicated
- Lipid-containing infusions (including 3-in-1 PN with lipids): change every 24 hours
- Blood and blood product sets: change after each unit, within 4 hours

See [PICC Care and Maintenance](/guides/picc-lines/picc-care-maintenance/) for the full protocol.

## PICC Complications: Overview

| Complication | Approximate Incidence | Key Prevention |
|---|---|---|
| CLABSI | 0.5–2.0 per 1,000 catheter-days | Insertion + maintenance bundle |
| PICC-associated DVT (UEDVT) | 1–5% symptomatic; higher asymptomatic | Minimize lumens, prompt removal |
| Catheter occlusion | 10–35% during dwell | Consistent flushing protocol |
| Phlebitis | 2–10% | Appropriate site/vein selection |
| Malposition | 2–10% at insertion | ECG guidance, experienced inserters |
| MARSI | Underreported | Atraumatic dressing technique |
| Catheter fracture/embolism | <1% | Avoid pinch-off syndrome risk factors |

See [PICC Complications: Prevention and Management](/guides/picc-lines/picc-complications-prevention/) and [Catheter Complications](/guides/catheter-complications/) for the full management guides.

---

## PICC Removal Protocol

PICC removal should occur as soon as the clinical indication no longer exists. **Daily catheter necessity review** is a core maintenance bundle element.

**Removal technique** (air embolism prevention):
1. Position patient **supine or in Trendelenburg** (negative thoracic pressure reduces air entry risk)
2. Instruct patient to perform **Valsalva maneuver** or hold breath during catheter removal
3. Remove catheter with **smooth, continuous traction** — do not jerk
4. Apply **occlusive pressure dressing** immediately; maintain for ≥30 minutes
5. Inspect catheter for integrity (measure tip-to-hub length; compare to insertion length)
6. Document removal: date, time, indication, catheter integrity, any difficulty, site appearance

**Contraindications to immediate removal:** suspected PICC-associated bacteremia — do not remove until blood cultures drawn and consultation obtained (removal may cause seeding during line manipulation if organism is actively bacteremic).

---

## Special Populations

- **Oncology patients**: PICC is appropriate for moderate-duration chemotherapy or OPAT. For long-term or intermittent therapy, implanted port is preferred. See [Oncology Vascular Access](/guides/vascular-access-special-populations/oncology-vascular-access-guide/).
- **Pediatric patients**: PICC sizing, site selection, and tip location calculations differ from adults. See [NICU Vascular Access](/guides/vascular-access-special-populations/nicu-vascular-access-guide/).
- **Renal patients (CKD 3–5, ESRD)**: Upper extremity PICCs should be avoided to preserve AV fistula creation sites. Lower extremity PICC or CVC may be considered. Consult nephrology.
- **Dialysis patients**: Do not place PICC in an arm with existing AV fistula or graft.
