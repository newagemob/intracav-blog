# PICC vs Midline vs CVC: Clinical Decision Guide

Selecting between a PICC, midline catheter, and non-tunneled CVC is one of the most common clinical decisions in vascular access. The choice depends on therapy requirements (osmolarity, vesicant properties, duration), patient anatomy and preferences, clinical setting, and complication risk profile. Getting this decision right minimizes patient harm and avoids unnecessary central access.

This guide provides a structured, evidence-based framework for choosing between these three device types.

## When to Choose a Midline Catheter

A midline catheter is the appropriate choice when:

**Duration:** IV therapy is expected to last 1–4 weeks and does not require central venous access for pharmacologic reasons.

**Osmolarity:** All planned infusates have osmolarity <600–800 mOsm/L. Most standard antibiotics (cefazolin, nafcillin, piperacillin-tazobactam) fall within peripheral tolerance range. Check specific formulation osmolarity.

**No vesicants, TPN, or pH extremes:** Midline tip location in the axillary or subclavian vein cannot tolerate caustic agents. Any therapy with pH <5 or >9, or vesicant potential, requires central access.

**Adequate upper arm veins:** Midlines require veins with diameter ≥3 mm for comfortable long-term cannulation. Basilic or brachial veins preferred.

**Patient does not meet PICC indications:** No ESRD-related vessel preservation concerns for midlines (shorter, does not compromise the veins used for AV fistula creation as significantly as PICC placement, but caution still warranted in pre-ESRD patients).

**Example scenarios appropriate for midline:**
- 10-day course of IV cefazolin for skin and soft tissue infection
- IV antibiotics for uncomplicated pneumonia (10–14 days) with adequate peripheral access
- IV fluid therapy in a patient with poor peripheral veins needing reliable 2-week access
- IV pain management for orthopedic recovery (non-vesicant opioids)

**Midline is NOT appropriate for:**
- TPN (even peripheral PN formulations approaching 900 mOsm/L require central access)
- Vesicant chemotherapy
- Therapy expected beyond 4 weeks
- Medications with known venous irritant properties requiring central placement
- Hemodialysis access

---

## When to Choose a PICC

A PICC is the appropriate choice when:

**Central access is required for pharmacologic reasons:** Osmolarity >900 mOsm/L (TPN, mannitol 20%, >10% dextrose), vesicants, pH extremes, or medications that require central access per prescribing information.

**Duration is ≥5–7 days with ongoing IV therapy needs:** Short-term therapy in patients with adequate peripheral access does not require a PICC per MAGIC criteria.

**OPAT (outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy):** Discharge to home or skilled nursing facility on IV antibiotics requires reliable long-term central access — PICC is the standard device for OPAT programs.

**Multi-lumen requirements:** Patient needs simultaneous administration of incompatible medications or multiple concurrent infusions beyond what a single PIV or midline can provide.

**Difficult peripheral venous access (DIVA score ≥4):** Patient with documented failed PIV attempts and ongoing IV therapy needs.

**IV therapy expected to continue post-discharge:** Pre-discharge PICC placement for patients going to home infusion, OPAT, or skilled nursing facility with IV therapy needs.

**PICC is NOT appropriate for:**
- ESRD or CKD Stage 3–5 without nephrology consultation (vessel preservation)
- IV therapy ≤5 days with adequate peripheral access
- Active DVT in target vein
- Patient with AV fistula or graft in the arm

## When to Choose a Non-Tunneled CVC

A non-tunneled CVC (placed via IJ, subclavian, or femoral approach) is appropriate when:

**Immediate central access is required:** Emergency resuscitation, hemodynamic instability, urgent medication delivery, or situations where time constraints preclude PICC placement.

**ICU hemodynamic monitoring:** Central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring requires central access; the IJ or subclavian approach places the catheter directly without the longer intravascular course of a PICC.

**Multiple lumens urgently required:** Critically ill patients needing simultaneous vasopressors, sedation infusions, TPN, and blood draws may require the immediate multi-lumen capability of a CVC.

**PICC is not feasible:** Bilateral upper extremity DVT, bilateral AV fistulas, bilateral lymphedema, severe arm burns, or other bilateral arm access contraindications may necessitate direct central access via IJ or subclavian.

**Short-term central access (days):** When central access is anticipated for only 5–7 days (e.g., ICU vasopressor support), a CVC avoids the PICC insertion process when central access will no longer be needed at discharge.

**Non-tunneled CVC is less appropriate when:**
- The patient is hemodynamically stable and could safely await PICC insertion
- The expected dwell time exceeds 2 weeks (PICC or tunneled catheter preferred)
- The patient does not require ICU-level care or monitoring

## The Osmolarity Decision Tree

Osmolarity is the primary pharmacologic driver of device selection for medication-related access:

```
What is the osmolarity of the planned infusate?

< 600 mOsm/L
  → Duration < 5 days → PIV
  → Duration 1–4 weeks, no vesicants → Midline

600–900 mOsm/L
  → Duration < 1 week, close monitoring → Midline (short-term acceptable)
  → Duration > 1 week → PICC or CVC

> 900 mOsm/L (TPN, concentrated KCl, mannitol 20%, chemotherapy)
  → Central access required → PICC or CVC

Vesicant (regardless of osmolarity)
  → Central access required → PICC or CVC
```

## Setting-Specific Decision Guidance

### Medical-Surgical Ward

Most PICC and midline decisions occur in med-surg settings where:
- Patients are hemodynamically stable
- Therapy is planned (IV antibiotics, TPN, hydration)
- Time allows for proper consent, US-guided insertion, and tip confirmation

**Default approach:** Apply the osmolarity/duration framework above. Most med-surg patients needing 1–3 weeks of non-vesicant IV therapy are midline candidates. Those needing vesicants, TPN, or OPAT planning are PICC candidates.

### Intensive Care Unit

ICU patients often need immediate multi-lumen central access:
- Acute hemodynamic instability → CVC (IJ or subclavian preferred)
- Once stabilized, and if ongoing central access expected >7–10 days → convert to PICC (removes CVC CLABSI risk from high-risk site; subclavian > IJ > femoral for CVC infection risk)
- Central access for vasopressors alone (short-term) → CVC; if vasopressors likely weaned within days, consider whether PICC is justified

### Emergency Department

- Emergent central access → CVC (rapid, direct)
- Observation admission with IV therapy needs → may not require central access if peripheral IV adequate for planned therapy duration

### Outpatient / Ambulatory

- OPAT, home TPN, long-term infusion → PICC is the standard device (removable, long-dwell, compatible with home care)
- Short outpatient infusion courses (single-day infusions, weekly chemotherapy) → PIV for each visit; PICC only if access failures are recurrent and documented

## Transition Points: When to Switch Devices

**CVC → PICC conversion:** As soon as a critically ill patient is hemodynamically stable and central access remains necessary beyond 5–7 days, transition from non-tunneled CVC to PICC. Evidence shows this reduces CLABSI risk, particularly for patients who would otherwise have prolonged CVC dwell.

**Midline → PICC upgrade:** If a patient on a midline is found to need TPN, vesicant therapy, or IV therapy beyond 4 weeks, plan PICC insertion before the midline's clinical indication expands beyond peripheral tolerance.

**PICC → port:** Patients requiring months to years of intermittent IV therapy (cancer, chronic TPN, recurrent infections) benefit from tunneled catheter or port placement over long-term PICC use. After 3–6 months of PICC use, port conversion is generally preferred for quality of life and infection risk reduction.

## Special Considerations

### ESRD and CKD Patients

Peripheral vessels in the arm are critical surgical access sites for AV fistula creation. Both PICCs and midlines consume upper extremity venous capital:

- **ESRD:** Avoid arm PICCs and midlines without explicit nephrology consultation
- **CKD Stage 3–5:** Strong preference to avoid arm PICCs; if central access required, consider non-tunneled CVC or tunneled catheter via IJ or femoral approach
- **CKD Stage 1–2:** Document vessel preservation considerations; PICC generally acceptable with informed discussion

### Pediatric Patients

For children, device selection applies similar principles with age-specific anatomic considerations:
- Neonates and infants: PICC sizing (1.9 Fr single-lumen neonatal PICC) and vein selection differs
- Children typically have adequate peripheral venous access for shorter therapy courses
- Long-term access in pediatric oncology often transitions to port
