# Vascular Access Team Models: Building and Measuring a VAT Program

The vascular access team (VAT) is one of the most evidence-supported quality improvement investments in hospital medicine. Institutions with dedicated, credentialed VAT programs consistently demonstrate lower CLABSI rates, higher first-stick success, fewer inappropriate device placements, and substantial cost savings compared to institutions relying on general nursing staff for all vascular access procedures.

This guide covers the full scope of VAT program design and management: the evidence base, program models, scope of practice, building the business case, quality metrics, governance, and the role of technology in modern VAT programs.

## What Is a Vascular Access Team (VAT)?

A **vascular access team (VAT)** is a specialized group of credentialed clinicians — typically RNs, but potentially including APRNs, PAs, RTs, or technicians depending on scope of practice and institutional structure — dedicated to the placement and management of vascular access devices across an institution.

VAT functions vary by program model but typically include:

- PICC insertion (with ultrasound guidance)
- Difficult peripheral IV access (US-guided or long dwell)
- Midline catheter placement
- Port access and troubleshooting
- IV therapy rounding and complication response
- Vascular access device appropriateness consultation
- Patient and staff education
- Policy development and quality improvement

The VAT is distinguished from **general nursing staff IV access** by: dedicated time allocation, specialized training and credentialing, higher procedural volume (which maintains skill), and a quality improvement focus.

---

## Evidence for Specialized Vascular Access Teams

The evidence supporting dedicated VAT programs is among the strongest in clinical nursing practice. Key findings:

### CLABSI Reduction

- Multiple prospective studies and quality improvement reports document **30–70% reductions in CLABSI rates** following implementation of dedicated VAT programs or PICC teams
- The mechanism: VAT clinicians with higher procedural volume maintain better technique, adherence to insertion bundles, and situational awareness of infection risk
- A 2013 study (O'Brien et al., *J Infus Nurs*) showed that implementing a dedicated PICC team reduced CLABSI from 3.2 to 0.4 per 1,000 catheter-days

### First-Stick Success

- General nursing staff first-stick PIV success rates: approximately **50–70%** for average patients; 25–40% for DIVA patients
- VAT clinicians with US-guided PIV expertise: **80–95%** first-stick success in difficult access patients
- Fewer insertion attempts means less pain, less vessel damage, and faster time to therapeutic infusion

### PICC Appropriateness

- Studies using MAGIC criteria (Chopra et al., 2015) found **20–40% inappropriate PICC placement rates** in institutions without VAT-led appropriateness review
- VAT-mediated consultation and appropriateness screening reduces inappropriate placement by **15–30%** in published programs
- Reduction in unnecessary PICC placements reduces downstream UEDVT, CLABSI, and catheter failure events

### Dwell Time and Device Optimization

- VAT programs are associated with **shorter PICC dwell time** — device removed sooner when no longer needed — through active daily necessity review and care rounding
- Earlier transition from central to peripheral access when appropriate reduces device-days and associated complication risk

## VAT Program Models

VAT programs exist across a wide spectrum from small single-site PICC teams to large multi-site vascular access services. Common models:

### Model 1: Dedicated PICC Team

A small group of specialized nurses (typically 2–6 FTEs for a 200–400 bed hospital) who perform all PICC insertions for the institution. May also manage port accesses and respond to difficult IV access consultations.

**Best for:** Mid-size to large acute care hospitals with moderate to high PICC volume; programs focused primarily on insertion quality and CLABSI reduction.

### Model 2: Full Vascular Access Service

A broader VAT that performs PICC insertion, difficult PIV, midline, port access, care rounding, appropriateness consultation, and patient/staff education. VAT nurses are available in-house during business hours; on-call or designee for off-hours insertions.

**Best for:** Large academic medical centers, cancer centers, or institutions with complex infusion therapy programs.

### Model 3: Advanced Practice-Led VAT

NPs or PAs lead the VAT, with scope to perform PICC, US-guided CVC, and advanced procedures beyond standard RN scope. Backed by a team of credentialed VAT RNs.

**Best for:** Institutions where NPs/PAs are credentialed for invasive procedures; sites with complex patient populations requiring advanced access.

### Model 4: Embedded Unit-Based VAT Model

Instead of a centralized VAT, selected unit-based RNs on each floor/unit receive enhanced vascular access training and serve as local VA champions. Coordinated by a centralized VA coordinator or educator.

**Best for:** Smaller hospitals where a centralized VAT is not cost-justified; institutions building toward a future centralized model.

### Model 5: 24/7 VAT Coverage

Full-time VAT with around-the-clock coverage for PICC insertion, difficult IV, and urgent consults. Requires significant staffing investment; typically limited to large academic centers.

---

## Scope of Practice for VAT Clinicians

VAT RN scope of practice is governed by:
- State nurse practice act (NPA)
- Hospital policy and credentialing requirements
- professional position statements
- Physician order requirements (for PICC insertion, midline placement)

**Standard VAT RN scope (most states):**
- Peripheral IV insertion (including US-guided)
- Midline catheter insertion (US-guided)
- PICC insertion with ultrasound guidance (under physician order; tip confirmation per institutional protocol)
- Port access and maintenance
- Catheter maintenance and troubleshooting
- Patient and caregiver education on catheter care
- Participation in policy and QI activities

**Typically NOT in VAT RN scope:**
- Non-tunneled CVC insertion (requires physician/APP privileges)
- Arterial line insertion (physician/APP)
- Tunneled catheter placement (IR/surgery)
- Independent initiation of tPA (requires physician order)

## Building a VAT Program: Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Needs Assessment

Collect baseline data before proposing a program:
- Current CLABSI rate by unit and overall
- PICC volume (insertions per month, inserters, settings)
- First-stick PIV success rate
- Rate of inappropriate PICC placement (using MAGIC criteria or audit)
- Staff satisfaction with current IV access processes
- Patient complaint data related to IV access

### Step 2: Build the Business Case

The financial case for a VAT is compelling when CLABSI prevention is properly valued. Key data points:
- Cost per CLABSI event: $46,000–$68,000 (includes extended hospital stay, treatment)
- If baseline CLABSI rate is 2.0/1,000 catheter-days with 10,000 catheter-days/year → 20 CLABSI events/year → $920,000–$1.36M in attributable costs
- A VAT reducing CLABSI rate to 0.5/1,000 catheter-days → 5 events/year → saves 15 events → $690,000–$1.02M saved/year
- Compare against VAT staffing cost (typically $150,000–$250,000/year for 2 FTE VAT RNs in benefits and salary)
- Additional ROI from: reduced inappropriate PICC placements, reduced downstream DVT and catheter failure costs, reduced PICC escalations, staff time saved from difficult IV access

Present the business case to nursing administration, CMO, and CFO. Align with current accreditation survey findings, CLABSI improvement goals, and nursing quality scorecards.

### Step 3: Administrative Approval and Governance

- Identify a physician champion (hospitalist, intensivist, or infectious disease physician) to co-sponsor the program
- Define reporting structure: VAT lead reports to CNO, Director of Nursing Quality, or Infection Prevention Director
- Create an interdisciplinary VAT oversight committee: VAT lead, physician champion, infection preventionist, pharmacy, quality
- Establish policy authority for VAT (can VAT nurses receive PICC consultation independently, or only via physician order?)

### Step 4: Hiring and Training

- Recruit experienced RNs with interest in vascular access; prior PICC experience a plus but not required
- Provide structured onboarding: current clinical standards education, anatomy and US technique training, simulation lab time, proctored clinical insertions (minimum per competency framework)
- Pursue VA-BC or CRNI certification for VAT staff (within first 12–18 months)
- Maintain continuing education budget

### Step 5: Launch and Integration

- Communicate the VAT service to physician staff, nursing staff, case management, and pharmacy
- Define the referral/consultation workflow (how does a nurse request a VAT consult?)
- Define response time expectations (e.g., urgent PICC request: 2-hour response; elective: next business day)
- Establish daily VAT rounding protocol for inpatients with CVADs

### Step 6: Measurement and Continuous Improvement

- Track monthly KPIs (see Quality Metrics section below)
- Review every complication event (CLABSI, DVT, failed insertion requiring escalation) within 72 hours
- Present quality data to VAT committee quarterly; share key metrics with nursing staff
- Submit CLABSI data to NHSN per regulatory requirement

## Quality Metrics for VAT Programs

| Metric | Definition | Target | Frequency |
|---|---|---|---|
| CLABSI rate | CLABSI events per 1,000 catheter-days | Zero or ≤0.5 | Monthly |
| First-stick success rate | % of PIV and PICC insertions achieved on first attempt | ≥90% PIV; ≥95% PICC | Monthly |
| Inappropriate PICC rate | % of PICC placements that do not meet MAGIC or institutional criteria | <10% | Monthly |
| PICC dwell time | Median days from insertion to removal | Per indication benchmarks | Monthly |
| Catheter-days | Total CVAD catheter-days per reporting period | Trending downward (indicates better device stewardship) | Monthly |
| Bundle compliance | % of insertions with complete insertion bundle | ≥95% | Per insertion (audited monthly) |
| DIVA assessment | % of PIV placements with documented DIVA score or equivalent | ≥80% | Monthly |
| Competency completion | % of VAT staff with current credentials (VA-BC, CRNI, competency modules) | 100% | Quarterly |

---

## VAT Program Governance

**Oversight committee:** Monthly interdisciplinary committee meeting (VAT lead, physician champion, infection prevention, quality). Review quality data, address operational issues, update policies, plan education.

**Medical directorship:** For programs with NP/APP-led scope, formal medical directorship provides physician oversight and facilitates physician privilege process.

**Policy authority:** The VAT should have primary responsibility for vascular access policy development and maintenance, in collaboration with the governance committee.

**Audit and compliance program:** Quarterly chart audit for PICC appropriateness, insertion bundle documentation, and daily necessity review compliance. Results presented to nursing leadership and medical staff.

## Technology for Modern VAT Programs

- **Electronic PICC request workflow**: Structured order sets that capture indication, therapy type, and duration — enables real-time appropriateness screening
- **Catheter tracking systems**: EHR-based dashboards tracking active catheter census, catheter-days, and due dates for dressing/tubing changes
- **Clinical decision support**: Alerts for PICCs exceeding expected dwell time, prompts for daily necessity review, DIVA score triggers for US guidance referral
- **Competency management systems**: Track VAT staff certifications, competency expiration dates, and procedure volumes
- **The Clinical Database**: Clinical policy reference, evidence-based guides, and competency tools supporting VAT program operations — see [The Clinical Database Vascular Access Knowledge Center](/guides/)
