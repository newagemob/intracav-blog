# PICC Insertion Competency Framework: From Novice to Independent Practice

PICC insertion is a complex vascular access procedure with a defined learning curve. Establishing a structured, defensible competency framework — from initial didactic training through independent practice — protects patients, reduces institutional liability, and produces consistently safe outcomes. This guide provides a complete framework for designing or implementing a PICC insertion competency program based on INS 2021 Standards, AVAR guidance, and published evidence on PICC procedure outcomes.

**Parent guide:** [Vascular Access Credentialing: Complete Reference](/guides/vascular-access-credentialing/)

## The Learning Curve

Multiple studies have documented the PICC insertion learning curve:

- **First-attempt success rate** improves significantly over the first 15–25 insertions
- **Malposition rate** (incorrect tip position) is highest in the first 10 insertions; stabilizes with experience
- **Time per insertion** decreases through the first 25–30 insertions

A training program minimum of 10–15 proctored cases (with target ≥25 within the first 6 months of independent practice) produces clinically safe outcomes in published studies.

## Program Structure Overview

### Phase 1: Didactic Training (16–24 hours)

**Required content modules:**

**Module 1: Anatomy and Physiology (2–3 hours)**
- Upper extremity venous anatomy (basilic, brachial, cephalic)
- Axillary, subclavian, brachiocephalic anatomy
- SVC and right heart anatomy
- Lymphatic considerations (lymphedema, mastectomy)
- Renal vasculature and vessel preservation for dialysis patients

**Module 2: Device Selection and Indications (2 hours)**
- MAGIC appropriateness criteria
- INS 2021 device selection principles
- PICC vs. midline vs. CVC decision algorithm
- Catheter types (power-injectable, valved, single/multi-lumen)
- Catheter-to-vein ratio and vein selection

**Module 3: Infection Prevention (2 hours)**
- CLABSI pathophysiology and risk factors
- Maximal sterile barrier (MSB) requirements and technique
- CHG antisepsis — dry time, application area
- ANTT principles
- Insertion bundle checklist

**Module 4: Ultrasound for PICC Insertion (4 hours)**
- Basic US physics and probe selection
- Transverse and longitudinal views
- In-plane vs. out-of-plane technique
- Vein identification and compressibility test
- Vein assessment (diameter, depth, thrombus)
- Guidewire US confirmation
- Pitfalls and troubleshooting

**Module 5: PICC Insertion Procedure (4 hours)**
- Pre-insertion measurement
- Sterile technique and MSB setup
- Modified Seldinger technique step-by-step
- Guidewire advancement and troubleshooting
- Peel-away sheath technique
- Catheter trimming and hub assembly

**Module 6: Tip Confirmation (2 hours)**
- Cavoatrial junction standard (CEVAD)
- ECG guidance: P-wave interpretation, systems, technique
- CXR interpretation: landmarks, acceptable vs. unacceptable positions
- Malposition types: recognition and management

**Module 7: Complications (2 hours)**
- PICC-associated DVT: risk factors, prevention, treatment
- Catheter occlusion: types, alteplase protocol
- Air embolism: prevention during insertion and removal
- Arterial cannulation recognition and management
- Nerve injury prevention (needle path planning)
- MARSI and CLABSI prevention

**Module 8: Documentation and Compliance (1 hour)**
- INS 2021 documentation requirements
- Insertion note mandatory elements
- TJC bundle documentation

**Assessment:** Written test; minimum 80% pass to proceed to simulation.

### Phase 2: Simulation Training (minimum 4 sessions)

**Session 1:** Probe handling, vessel identification, compressibility testing on vascular phantom.

**Session 2:** US-guided venipuncture and guidewire placement in phantom.

**Session 3:** Full simulated PICC insertion on phantom (MSB setup through catheter placement).

**Session 4:** Repeat full insertion; troubleshooting scenarios (guidewire resistance, no blood return, catheter won't advance).

**Simulation competency sign-off** before proceeding to clinical proctoring.

### Phase 3: Proctored Clinical Insertions (minimum 10–15 cases)

**Proctor requirements:**
- Credentialed PICC inserter with ≥12 months independent experience
- Proctor is present at the bedside for the entire procedure (not available by phone)
- Proctor completes standardized competency checklist for each case

**Trainee requirements:**
- Performs all steps independently under observation (proctor does not take over except for patient safety)
- Debriefing session after each procedure

**Success criteria:**
- Minimum 90% checklist compliance averaged over all proctored cases
- Demonstrated safe technique throughout
- No pattern of repeated errors despite feedback

### Phase 4: Independent Practice Initiation

After completing the minimum proctored cases with satisfactory performance:
- Submit competency documentation to hospital privileging office
- Privileges granted for independent PICC insertion
- New independent inserter performs first 10–15 independent insertions with a credentialed inserter available for consultation (not necessarily at the bedside)

## PICC Insertion Competency Checklist

### Pre-Insertion
- [ ] Verified PICC indication meets MAGIC/INS criteria; documented in chart
- [ ] Reviewed contraindications (ESRD, DVT, AV fistula, ESRD vessels)
- [ ] Obtained and documented informed consent
- [ ] Performed bilateral US vein survey; documented findings
- [ ] Calculated catheter-to-vein ratio; selected appropriate device
- [ ] Measured pre-insertion catheter length accurately

### Insertion Bundle Elements
- [ ] Performed hand hygiene immediately before gloving
- [ ] Applied maximal sterile barrier (full-body drape, sterile gown, sterile gloves, surgical mask, cap)
- [ ] Applied CHG/IPA antisepsis to adequate area; confirmed complete dry time
- [ ] Documented clinical indication for central access

### Sterile Technique Maintenance
- [ ] Maintained sterile field throughout procedure (no breaks identified)
- [ ] Managed any break in technique appropriately (acknowledged, corrected)

### Ultrasound-Guided Insertion
- [ ] Applied sterile probe cover correctly; no contamination of sterile field
- [ ] Identified target vein in transverse and/or long-axis view
- [ ] Confirmed compressibility; identified adjacent artery
- [ ] Applied tourniquet; identified optimal insertion site
- [ ] Visualized needle tip entering vein; confirmed blood return before advancing guidewire
- [ ] Confirmed guidewire in vein by US before removing needle

### Catheter Placement
- [ ] Nicked skin at guidewire entry site appropriately
- [ ] Advanced dilator/sheath without resistance
- [ ] Peeled sheath without advancing catheter simultaneously
- [ ] Advanced catheter to pre-measured length
- [ ] External length matches pre-measured target

### Post-Insertion Verification
- [ ] Aspirated blood return from all lumens
- [ ] Flushed all lumens; no resistance, no swelling
- [ ] Applied CHG gel patch and TSM dressing correctly
- [ ] Applied securement device correctly
- [ ] Ordered/initiated tip confirmation (ECG guidance documentation or CXR order)
- [ ] Labeled dressing with date, length, gauge, inserter initials

### Documentation
- [ ] Completed insertion note with all required elements
- [ ] Documented MSB compliance
- [ ] Documented CHG antisepsis and dry time confirmation
- [ ] Documented tip confirmation method and result

**Overall assessment:** ☐ Meets Standard ☐ Does Not Meet Standard

## Annual Competency Maintenance

To maintain PICC insertion privileges, clinicians must demonstrate ongoing competency:

**Volume requirement:** Minimum 12 PICC insertions per year. Clinicians inserting fewer than 12 PICCs per year should discuss with program leadership whether PICC insertion is still an appropriate scope for them; additional proctoring may be required.

**Annual assessment options:**
1. Simulation laboratory performance with competency sign-off
2. Observed clinical insertion with competency checklist
3. Chart audit of recent insertion documentation for compliance

**Outcome review:** Annual review of individual outcome data:
- First-attempt success rate (target: ≥85% for credentialed inserters)
- Insertion-related complication rate (arterial puncture, nerve injury, malposition)
- Bundle compliance documentation rate

Clinicians with outcome metrics below benchmark should receive individualized feedback, retraining, and increased supervision.
