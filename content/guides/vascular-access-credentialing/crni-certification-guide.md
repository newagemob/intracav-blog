# CRNI Certification: Complete Guide to Certified Registered Nurse Infusion

The **CRNI (Certified Registered Nurse Infusion)** is the specialty certification for infusion nursing practice in the United States, administered by the **Infusion Nurses Certification Corporation (INCC)**, the certification body affiliated with the **Infusion Nurses Society (INS)**. The CRNI validates advanced knowledge across the full scope of infusion therapy — vascular access, medication infusion, infection prevention, and patient care — and is the recognized credential for infusion nursing specialists.

## What Is the CRNI?

The CRNI is a broad **infusion therapy specialty certification** covering the full scope of infusion nursing practice: not just vascular access, but medication administration, parenteral nutrition, blood products, oncology infusion, pain management, infection control, and infusion therapy documentation.

While the VA-BC (Vascular Access Board Certified) is focused specifically on vascular access device practice, the CRNI is broader — encompassing all aspects of the infusion therapy practice setting.

**Who pursues the CRNI:**
- Infusion therapy specialist nurses
- Home infusion nurses
- Ambulatory infusion center nurses
- IV team nurses with broad infusion responsibilities beyond vascular access device insertion
- Nurses seeking to validate expertise across the full INS Standards scope

**CRNI is the right credential when:** Your practice encompasses the full scope of infusion therapy (access + all infusion therapies + patient management across multiple settings).

**VA-BC is the right credential when:** Your practice is focused primarily on vascular access device selection, insertion, and management.

**Many clinicians hold both** — particularly VAT nurses who both insert PICCs (VA-BC scope) and manage complex infusion therapy (CRNI scope).

## Administering Organization: INS/INCC

**INS (Infusion Nurses Society):** The professional membership organization for infusion nurses; publishes the INS Infusion Therapy Standards of Practice (the gold standard reference for both the CRNI exam and vascular access nursing practice). Membership provides access to INS publications, educational resources, and the Journal of Infusion Nursing.

**INCC (Infusion Nurses Certification Corporation):** The independent certification body for the CRNI credential. Administers the examination, sets eligibility criteria, and manages recertification. Website: incertnurse.org.

## CRNI Eligibility Requirements

As of the most recent INCC published criteria:

**Current valid nursing license:** Current, active RN licensure in the United States or Canada.

**Clinical experience in infusion therapy:**
- Minimum **1,600 hours** of infusion therapy clinical experience in the past 24 months

**Definition of infusion therapy experience:** Direct patient care involving IV infusion, vascular access device care, or specialty infusion therapy. May include hospital-based infusion nursing, home infusion, ambulatory infusion, and VAT roles.

## CRNI Exam Content Domains

The INCC publishes an exam content outline based on regular Role Delineation Studies of infusion nursing practice. Major domains:

### Infusion Therapy
- Patient assessment for infusion needs
- Evidence-based infusion practice (INS Standards)
- Drug/fluid compatibility
- Osmolarity, pH, and infusate properties
- High-alert medications
- Filtration requirements

### Vascular Access Devices
- PIV, midline, PICC, CVC, port, tunneled CVC
- Device selection (INS principles, VHP, MAGIC)
- Insertion technique overview
- Catheter care and maintenance (dressing, flushing, securement)
- Tip location standards

### Infection Prevention
- CLABSI bundles (insertion and maintenance)
- Hand hygiene and ANTT
- CHG antisepsis
- Surveillance and reporting

### Complications
- Infiltration and extravasation (vesicant antidotes, INS staging)
- Phlebitis (VIP scale)
- Thrombosis
- Occlusion (alteplase)
- Air embolism
- Infection recognition and response

### Special Therapies
- Parenteral nutrition
- Blood and blood products
- Patient-controlled analgesia
- Oncology infusion
- Subcutaneous and epidural access

### Patient Education and Discharge Planning
- Home infusion preparation
- OPAT planning
- Patient self-care education

### Professional Practice
- Scope of practice
- Documentation
- Quality improvement
- Evidence-based practice
- Legal and ethical considerations

## CRNI Exam Format

- **Format:** Computer-based, multiple choice
- **Number of questions:** 150 items (approximately 135 scored)
- **Time:** 3 hours
- **Testing:** Pearson VUE testing centers or remote proctored
- **Passing standard:** Set by INCC via standard-setting process; not a fixed percentage

## CRNI vs. VA-BC: Which Credential Is Right for You?

| Feature | CRNI | VA-BC |
|---|---|---|
| **Primary focus** | Full infusion therapy scope | Vascular access devices specifically |
| **Administering body** | INCC/INS | CBVN/AVAR |
| **Primary reference** | INS Standards of Practice | INS Standards + AVAR position statements |
| **Hour requirement** | 1,600 hours infusion nursing | 1,500 hours vascular access practice |
| **Exam depth** | Broader (all infusion therapy) | Deeper on vascular access specifically |
| **Best for** | Full infusion specialist, home infusion RN | VAT nurse, IV team with device focus |
| **Renewal** | CE pathway; 40+ hours | CE pathway; 40 CE hours vascular access specific |

**Recommendation:** If you are in a dedicated vascular access team role inserting PICCs as your primary procedure, pursue the VA-BC first. If you are in a broad infusion therapy specialist role (home infusion, ambulatory infusion center, IV team with full therapy management responsibilities), the CRNI may better reflect your full scope.

## CRNI Exam Preparation

### Primary Study References

**INS Infusion Therapy Standards of Practice (2021):** The authoritative reference for the CRNI examination. The exam tests knowledge aligned with the INS Standards — knowing the Standards is the single most important preparation activity.

**Core Curriculum for Infusion Nursing (INS):** Published textbook aligned with INS Standards; comprehensive coverage of all CRNI exam domains. Available through INS bookstore.

**INS Online Education:** INS provides CRNI exam prep courses and modules via the INS website; available to members and for purchase.

**Journal of Infusion Nursing:** Review recent issues for current evidence updates relevant to exam content.

### Study Tips

- Map your study to the INCC content outline (available at incertnurse.org) — allocate study time proportionally to domain weighting
- Focus on clinical decision-making scenarios — the exam tests application, not just recall
- Know the critical numbers: osmolarity thresholds (600, 900 mOsm/L), alteplase dose (2 mg/2 mL), dressing change intervals, VIP phlebitis scale grades, MAGIC criteria thresholds

---

## Recertification Requirements

CRNI certification is valid for **3 years**.

**Recertification options:**
- **CE pathway:** Complete continuing education hours (verify current requirements at INCC — typically 40 hours of infusion therapy-relevant CE) plus maintain clinical practice
- **Re-examination:** Retake and pass the CRNI exam
