# CRNI Certification: Complete Guide to Certified Registered Nurse Infusion

The **CRNI (Certified Registered Nurse Infusion)** is the specialty certification for infusion nursing practice in the United States, administered by **CVAA**. The CRNI validates advanced knowledge across the full scope of infusion therapy — vascular access, medication infusion, infection prevention, and patient care — and is the recognized credential for infusion nursing specialists.

**Parent guide:** [Vascular Access Credentialing: Complete Reference](/guides/vascular-access-credentialing/)

## What Is the CRNI?

The CRNI is a broad **infusion therapy specialty certification** covering the full scope of infusion nursing practice: not just vascular access, but medication administration, parenteral nutrition, blood products, oncology infusion, pain management, infection control, and infusion therapy documentation.

While the VA-BC (Vascular Access Board Certified) is focused specifically on vascular access device practice, the CRNI is broader — encompassing all aspects of the infusion therapy practice setting.

**Who pursues the CRNI:**
- Infusion therapy specialist nurses
- Home infusion nurses
- Ambulatory infusion center nurses
- IV team nurses with broad infusion responsibilities beyond vascular access device insertion
- Nurses seeking to validate expertise across the full scope of infusion therapy

**CRNI is the right credential when:** Your practice encompasses the full scope of infusion therapy (access + all infusion therapies + patient management across multiple settings).

**VA-BC is the right credential when:** Your practice is focused primarily on vascular access device selection, insertion, and management.

**Many clinicians hold both** — particularly VAT nurses who both insert PICCs (VA-BC scope) and manage complex infusion therapy (CRNI scope).

## Administering Organization: CVAA

**CVAA:** The professional organization for infusion nurses and the administering body for the CRNI credential. Administers the examination, sets eligibility criteria, manages recertification, and provides access to publications, educational resources, and the Journal of Infusion Nursing. Website: incertnurse.org.

## CRNI Eligibility Requirements

As of the most recent CVAA published criteria:

**Current valid nursing license:** Current, active RN licensure in the United States or Canada.

**Clinical experience in infusion therapy:**
- Minimum **1,600 hours** of infusion therapy clinical experience in the past 24 months

**Definition of infusion therapy experience:** Direct patient care involving IV infusion, vascular access device care, or specialty infusion therapy. May include hospital-based infusion nursing, home infusion, ambulatory infusion, and VAT roles.

- Insertion technique overview
- Catheter care and maintenance (dressing, flushing, securement)
- Tip location standards

### Infection Prevention

- Hand hygiene and ANTT
- CHG antisepsis
- Surveillance and reporting

### Complications
- Infiltration and extravasation (vesicant antidotes, graded staging)
- Phlebitis (VIP scale)
- Thrombosis
- Occlusion (alteplase)
- Air embolism
- Infection recognition and response

### Special Therapies
- Parenteral nutrition
- Blood and blood products
- Patient-controlled analgesia
- Oncology infusion
- Subcutaneous and epidural access

### Patient Education and Discharge Planning
- Home infusion preparation
- OPAT planning
- Patient self-care education

### Professional Practice

## CRNI vs. VA-BC: Which Credential Is Right for You?

| Feature | CRNI | VA-BC |
|---|---|---|
| **Primary focus** | Full infusion therapy scope | Vascular access devices specifically |
| **Administering body** | CVAA | CBVN/AVAR |
| **Primary reference** | current clinical standards | current clinical standards + AVAR position statements |
| **Hour requirement** | 1,600 hours infusion nursing | 1,500 hours vascular access practice |
| **Exam depth** | Broader (all infusion therapy) | Deeper on vascular access specifically |
| **Best for** | Full infusion specialist, home infusion RN | VAT nurse, IV team with device focus |
| **Renewal** | CE pathway; 40+ hours | CE pathway; 40 CE hours vascular access specific |

**Recommendation:** If you are in a dedicated vascular access team role inserting PICCs as your primary procedure, pursue the VA-BC first. If you are in a broad infusion therapy specialist role (home infusion, ambulatory infusion center, IV team with full therapy management responsibilities), the CRNI may better reflect your full scope.

## CRNI Exam Preparation

### Primary Study References

**Core Curriculum for Infusion Nursing:** Published textbook providing comprehensive coverage of all CRNI exam domains. Available through the CVAA bookstore.

**CVAA Online Education:** CVAA provides CRNI exam prep courses and modules via the CVAA website; available to members and for purchase.

**Journal of Infusion Nursing:** Review recent issues for current evidence updates relevant to exam content.

### Study Tips

- Map your study to the CVAA content outline (available at incertnurse.org) — allocate study time proportionally to domain weighting
- Focus on clinical decision-making scenarios — the exam tests application, not just recall
- Know the critical numbers: osmolarity thresholds (600, 900 mOsm/L), alteplase dose (2 mg/2 mL), dressing change intervals, VIP phlebitis scale grades, MAGIC criteria thresholds

---

## Recertification Requirements

CRNI certification is valid for **3 years**.

**Recertification options:**
- **CE pathway:** Complete continuing education hours (verify current requirements at CVAA — typically 40 hours of infusion therapy-relevant CE) plus maintain clinical practice
- **Re-examination:** Retake and pass the CRNI exam
