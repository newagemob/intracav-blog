# VA-BC Certification: Complete Guide to Vascular Access Board Certification

The **VA-BC (Vascular Access Board Certified)** credential is the premier certification for vascular access specialty nurses and clinicians in the United States. Administered by the **Certification Board of Vascular Nursing (CBVN)**, a certification body established by the **Association for Vascular Access (AVAR/AVA)**, the VA-BC certification validates advanced knowledge and competence in vascular access practice across the full spectrum of devices, patient populations, and care settings.

**Parent guide:** [Vascular Access Credentialing: Complete Reference](/guides/vascular-access-credentialing/)

## What Is the VA-BC?

The VA-BC is a **specialty practice certification** — not a licensure examination — that validates that a nurse or clinician has demonstrated knowledge above the generalist level in vascular access practice. It is the recognized credential for:
- Vascular access team (VAT) nurses
- IV therapy specialty nurses
- Clinicians who perform or manage PICC insertion and CVAD care as a primary or significant part of their practice
- Clinicians seeking to formalize and credential their vascular access expertise

**The VA-BC is not required** to insert PICCs or manage CVADs in most institutional settings (institutional credentialing and privileging determines that). However, it is increasingly expected in VAT leadership roles and is used in institutional privileging processes as evidence of validated expertise.

## Administering Organization: CBVN/AVAR

**AVAR (Association for Vascular Access):** The professional membership organization for vascular access clinicians in the United States. Formerly known as NAVAN (National Association of Vascular Access Networks). AVAR publishes position statements, supports research, and provides educational resources for vascular access clinicians.

**CBVN (Certification Board of Vascular Nursing):** The independent certification body established by AVAR. Administers the VA-BC examination, sets eligibility criteria, and manages recertification.

**Website:** avar.org / cbvn.net (confirm current URLs at time of application)

---

## VA-BC Eligibility Requirements

As of the most recent CBVN published criteria:

**Current valid nursing license (RN):** A current, active RN license in the United States is required.

**Clinical experience in vascular access:**
- Minimum **1,500 hours** of vascular access clinical experience in the past 3 years
- The 1,500 hours must be in vascular access clinical practice — not exclusively administrative or educational roles

**What counts toward 1,500 hours:**
- Bedside vascular access practice (PICC insertion, catheter management, IV therapy)
- VAT clinical role
- Vascular access program coordination with direct clinical component
- Home infusion nursing with significant vascular access practice

**What does NOT count:**
- General nursing hours without a vascular access focus
- Administrative hours without direct clinical care
- Educational hours without clinical component

**Verification:** The eligibility attestation requires a signed verification from a supervisor or manager confirming the hours claimed.

## VA-BC Exam Content Blueprint

The CBVN publishes a content outline (blueprint) for the VA-BC exam. The exam tests knowledge across the full vascular access scope of practice. Major content domains (approximate weightings vary by exam version — verify with current CBVN blueprint):

### Domain 1: Device Selection and Insertion
- Evidence-based device selection (, MAGIC criteria)
- Vessel health and preservation
- Patient assessment for vascular access
- Insertion techniques (PIV, midline, PICC)
- Ultrasound-guided access
- Tip location standards (CEVAD)
- Informed consent

### Domain 2: Catheter Care and Maintenance
- Dressing and securement
- Flushing and locking (SASH protocol)
- Administration set management
- Needleless connectors
- Blood sampling through CVADs
- Patient education

### Domain 3: Infection Prevention
- CLABSI insertion and maintenance bundles
- Hand hygiene and ANTT
- CHG antisepsis
- Surveillance and reporting

### Domain 4: Complication Recognition and Management
- DVT and thrombosis
- Occlusion and alteplase
- Phlebitis (VIP scale)
- Infiltration and extravasation (graded staging, vesicant antidotes)
- Air embolism
- Catheter malposition
- MARSI

### Domain 5: Infusion Therapy Safety
- Osmolarity and pH thresholds
- Vesicant classification
- Filtration requirements
- High-alert medications
- Drug compatibility

### Domain 6: Special Populations
- Pediatrics and neonates
- Oncology
- Renal/dialysis patients
- Critical care

### Domain 7: Professional Practice
- Scope of practice and credentialing
- Documentation requirements
- Quality improvement
- Evidence-based practice
- Regulatory framework (CDC, TJC, CMS)

## Exam Format

- **Format:** Computer-based, multiple choice
- **Number of questions:** 150 items (some may be pretest/non-scored items; scored items are approximately 125)
- **Time:** 3.5 hours
- **Testing locations:** Pearson VUE testing centers nationally, and remote proctored online option
- **Passing score:** Determined by CBVN via modified Angoff standard-setting process; pass/fail threshold is not a fixed percentage (typically approximately 70–75% of scored items)
- **Results:** Pass/fail results provided immediately at testing center; official certificate mailed within 2–4 weeks

---

## Application Process

1. Review current CBVN eligibility criteria at cbvn.net
2. Complete online application; gather supporting documents:
   - Copy of current nursing license
   - Supervisor verification of 1,500+ clinical hours
3. Pay application and exam fee (fees subject to change; AVAR members may receive discounted rate)
4. Receive Authorization to Test (ATT) from Pearson VUE
5. Schedule exam at Pearson VUE center or online
6. Take exam; receive immediate pass/fail result

---

## Exam Preparation Strategies

### Review Resources

**Core Curriculum for Infusion Nursing:** Published by CVAA; extensive reference text for exam preparation covering all domains.

**AVAR VA-BC Study Guide:** Available through AVAR; specifically aligned with CBVN content blueprint.

**Flashcards and practice questions:** Several commercial VA-BC question banks exist (verify they align with current exam blueprint).

### Study Approach

- Study from the CBVN content outline — ensure you have studied material in every domain
- Know key clinical standards categories: tip location, dressing protocols, flushing intervals — questions test application of these standards
- Memorize key clinical numbers: osmolarity thresholds (600, 900 mOsm/L), dressing change intervals, alteplase dose (2 mg/2 mL), DIVA score criteria, phlebitis VIP scale grades
- Practice applying clinical scenarios to decision frameworks (VHP, MAGIC, osmolarity algorithm)

---

## Recertification Requirements

VA-BC certification is valid for **3 years**.

To recertify:
- **Option 1 (CE pathway):** Complete **40 hours of vascular access-specific continuing education** during the 3-year certification period, plus maintain active RN licensure and employment in vascular access clinical practice
- **Option 2 (re-examination):** Retake and pass the VA-BC exam

**Practice hours requirement:** 1,500 hours of vascular access clinical practice must still be verifiable during the 3-year period.
