# Ultrasound Credentialing in Vascular Access Programs: Implementation Guide

Implementing ultrasound guidance in a vascular access program transforms outcomes — but only when paired with a structured credentialing framework. Ad hoc ultrasound use without training and competency documentation creates liability exposure, inconsistent technique, and potentially worse outcomes than landmark technique in untrained hands. This guide addresses the program leadership perspective: how to design, implement, and maintain an ultrasound credentialing program for vascular access practice.

## Program Design Decisions

Before building the credentialing program, define:

### 1. Which Procedures Require Ultrasound Credentialing?

Most programs credential for three levels:

**Level 1: US-Guided Peripheral IV (US-PIV)**
- For: ED nurses, med-surg nurses with dedicated DIVA patient populations, home infusion nurses
- Complexity: Moderate; can be learned quickly
- Credentialing scope: Shorter training program; lower proctored case minimum

**Level 2: US-Guided Midline and PICC Insertion**
- For: VAT nurses, IV specialty nurses
- Complexity: High; requires comprehensive training and significant proctored experience
- Credentialing scope: Full PICC training program including US component; cannot be separated

**Level 3: US-Guided IJ/CVC**
- For: MD, PA, NP, advanced practice clinical staff with procedural privileges
- Complexity: High; involves proximity to carotid artery, pneumothorax risk
- Credentialing scope: Medical staff credentialing process; often handled through GME training or CME credentialing

### 2. Who Are the Proctors?

**Proctor qualifications:**
- Credentialed in the procedure to be proctored (minimum 12–24 months independent practice)
- Demonstrated proficient performance (no ongoing quality concerns)
- Completed a proctoring training module (observational assessment, feedback, documentation)

**Proctor-to-trainee ratio:** During active proctoring periods, ensure proctor availability. Avoid having one proctor supervise multiple concurrent trainees in separate rooms — the proctor must be physically present at the bedside.

### 3. What Equipment Will Be Used?

Standardize on a specific US machine model for training — trainees should learn on the machine they will use in clinical practice. Using a different machine for simulation and a different one in clinical practice creates a learning barrier.

**Equipment considerations:**
- Probe selection (10–15 MHz linear for vascular access)
- Sterile probe cover compatibility
- Machine portability (bedside use)
- Battery life for room-to-room use

## Curriculum Design by Level

### US-PIV Credentialing Program

**Target audience:** Bedside nurses, ED nurses, IV start team nurses.

**Training program:**
- Didactic: 2–3 hours (anatomy, probe technique, vein selection, catheter length selection, DIVA score)
- Simulation: 2–4 sessions on vascular phantom
- Proctored cases: 5–10 (direct bedside observation with competency checklist)
- Knowledge assessment: 80% pass minimum

**Key competencies:**
- Identifies vein in transverse view; confirms compressibility
- Measures vein diameter and depth; selects appropriate catheter length
- Performs dynamic needle guidance; identifies needle tip in vessel
- Recognizes when to escalate (vein too deep, too small, therapy requires central access)

**Maintenance:**
- Annual skills validation or observed clinical performance
- Volume minimum: 15–20 US-PIVs per year (lower volume = skill atrophy)

### US-PICC Credentialing Program

**Target audience:** VAT nurses, specialized IV team nurses.

**This is the US component of the full PICC training program** — not a standalone credential. US competency is validated as part of the PICC insertion competency framework.

See [PICC Insertion Competency Framework](/guides/vascular-access-credentialing/picc-insertion-competency-framework/) for complete curriculum.

US-specific competencies within PICC credentialing:
- Bilateral vein survey before insertion
- Calculates catheter-to-vein ratio
- Performs long-axis (in-plane) basilic vein cannulation
- Confirms guidewire in vein on US before proceeding
- Integrates with ECG tip guidance

## Simulation Resources

### Vascular Phantoms

Commercial vascular phantoms (Blue Phantom, Simulab, CAE Healthcare) provide realistic vessel simulation:

- Blue Phantom arm phantom: basilic, brachial, cephalic veins at realistic depths
- Allows practice of compressibility testing, needle advancement, guidewire placement
- Replaceable vessel modules for extended use

**Homemade phantoms:** Gelatin-based phantoms with embedded tubing can be made for low-cost simulation. Adequate for initial training but less realistic than commercial products.

**Water-in-glove phantoms:** Very low-cost; useful for basic probe handling and needle visualization practice but insufficient for full PICC simulation.

### Task Trainers vs. Full Simulation

**Task trainers (recommended for all US vascular access training):** Focus on the specific psychomotor skill (probe handling, needle-probe coordination). Efficient for the core technique learning.

**Full procedural simulation (recommended for PICC only):** Simulated full PICC procedure including setup, sterile technique, insertion, and tip confirmation. Requires a mannequin or procedural simulator capable of supporting the full procedure.

## Maintaining Proctorship Records

Each proctored case must produce a permanent record:

**Required elements in proctored case documentation:**
- Date
- Patient MRN (anonymized in training records; full in procedure note)
- Procedure performed
- Supervising proctor name and credential
- Trainee name
- Competency checklist completion and result
- Specific feedback provided (optional but valuable)
- Proctor signature and trainee signature

**Storage:** Employee training record; competency file; program training database.

## Program-Level Quality Metrics

Beyond individual credentialing, track program-level US outcomes:

| Metric | Target | Benchmark Source |
|---|---|---|
| US-guided first-attempt success rate (PICC) | ≥95% | INS/AVAR literature |
| US-guided first-attempt success rate (PIV) | ≥80% | Published US-PIV studies |
| Inadvertent arterial cannulation rate | <1% | INS quality metrics |
| PICC insertion malposition rate | <5% | Published VAT benchmarks |
| Proctored case completion rate | 100% before independent | Program requirement |
| Annual volume compliance | ≥90% of credentialed staff | Program standard |

Report these metrics quarterly to program leadership and annually to nursing quality committee.

## When a Clinician Loses Proficiency

Define triggers and response:

**Trigger:** Volume falls below minimum (<12 PICCs/year, <15 US-PIVs/year) AND no remediation plan in place.

**Response:**
1. Privileges under review; notify clinician
2. Review of recent outcomes data for any complications
3. Determine remediation: simulation refresher + supervised cases
4. Reassess after remediation; restore privileges or restrict further

**Trigger:** Complication event directly related to US technique (arterial cannulation, nerve injury).

**Response:**
1. Immediate privilege suspension pending review
2. Root cause analysis (was this a technique error, an equipment issue, an anatomic variant?)
3. Focused retraining if technique error identified
4. Additional proctored cases before privileges restoration
