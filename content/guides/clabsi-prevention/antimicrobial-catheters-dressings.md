# Antimicrobial Catheters and Dressings: Evidence for High-Risk CLABSI Settings

Standard insertion and maintenance bundles reduce CLABSI rates by 60–70% in most settings. For units that still experience CLABSI events despite full bundle compliance, antimicrobial-impregnated catheters and supplemental antimicrobial dressing strategies offer evidence-based additive risk reduction. These technologies should be deployed strategically — as part of an escalation response to persistent high rates, not as a substitute for fundamental bundle implementation.

## When to Consider Antimicrobial Technologies

Per CDC 2011 and SHEA/IDSA 2022 recommendations:

Consider antimicrobial-impregnated catheters when:
- CLABSI rate remains above institutional goal **despite full implementation and documented compliance with the standard insertion and maintenance bundles**
- CLABSI rate is >2 per 1,000 catheter-days (a threshold where antimicrobial catheters have demonstrated benefit in RCTs)
- High-risk populations where even low CLABSI rates carry extreme consequence (immunocompromised oncology, cardiac surgery ICU, neonatal ICU)

**These are not first-line universal interventions.** The evidence for antimicrobial catheters assumes baseline bundle compliance. Using antimicrobial catheters as a substitute for proper hand hygiene, maximal sterile barrier, or CHG antisepsis is not supported by evidence and would not produce the expected benefit.

## Antimicrobial-Impregnated Catheters

### Type 1: CHG/Silver Sulfadiazine (CHG/SS) Catheters

**Product:** External surface impregnated with chlorhexidine gluconate + silver sulfadiazine. The external surface coating prevents extraluminal colonization.

**Mechanism:** CHG/SS on the external catheter surface creates a bactericidal zone that inhibits skin organism migration along the catheter exterior — the primary extraluminal infection route.

**Evidence:**
- Multiple RCTs demonstrate that first-generation CHG/SS catheters (external surface only) reduce catheter colonization and CLABSI in ICU patients.
- Maki et al. (1997, *NEJM*): CHG/SS catheters reduced catheter-related infection by 56% compared to standard catheters.
- Second-generation CHG/SS catheters (external AND internal surfaces impregnated) show greater efficacy and are now the standard product.

**Limitations:**
- Coating degrades over catheter dwell time; most effective for dwell <14 days
- Rare allergic reactions reported (CHG component)
- Does not address intraluminal contamination (hub-related infection)

### Type 2: Minocycline-Rifampin (M/R) Catheters

**Product:** Both internal and external catheter surfaces impregnated with minocycline and rifampin. Provides both extraluminal and intraluminal antibacterial activity.

**Mechanism:** Broad-spectrum antibacterial activity from inside and outside the catheter surface; addresses both intraluminal and extraluminal colonization routes.

**Evidence:**
- Darouiche et al. (1999, *NEJM*): M/R catheters had lower CLABSI rates than first-generation CHG/SS catheters (0.3 vs. 3.4 per 1,000 catheter-days).
- Subsequent meta-analyses confirm M/R catheter superiority over first-generation CHG/SS; head-to-head comparison with second-generation CHG/SS shows comparable efficacy.

**Limitations:**
- Resistance concern: rifampin resistance development is theoretically possible with prolonged use; most studies have not demonstrated clinically significant resistance emergence
- Not appropriate for patients with known allergy to tetracyclines or rifampin
- Minocycline-rifampin catheters are not recommended for patients with rifampin-sensitive mycobacterial disease (rifampin monotherapy selects resistance in mycobacteria)
- Higher cost than standard or CHG/SS catheters

### Selecting Between CHG/SS and M/R Catheters

| Factor | CHG/SS | Minocycline-Rifampin |
|---|---|---|
| Primary mechanism | External surface | Internal + external |
| Resistance concern | Theoretical CHG tolerance | Rifampin resistance (theoretical) |
| Allergy concern | CHG allergy | Tetracycline/rifampin allergy |
| Best evidence setting | General ICU | General ICU; CLABSI >2/1,000 |
| Cost | Moderate | Higher |

Both types are Category IA recommendations (CDC) for use when CLABSI rates remain above target despite standard bundle implementation.

## Antimicrobial Dressings

### Silver-Containing Dressings

Silver has well-established antimicrobial properties. Silver-impregnated dressings at catheter exit sites (for tunneled catheters and ports) have been studied as alternatives or adjuncts to CHG-impregnated dressings.

**Evidence:** Less robust than for CHG dressings. Some studies show reduced exit-site infection rates with silver dressings; direct comparison with CHG-impregnated dressings is limited. Silver dressings may be useful alternatives when CHG allergy precludes standard CHG dressing use.

### Passive Disinfection Caps (Alcohol-Impregnated Connector Caps)

**Products:** Curos Disinfecting Port Protector, SwabCap, others. Small caps filled with 70% IPA that sit on needleless connectors between uses, providing continuous alcohol contact.

**Mechanism:** Continuous alcohol exposure to the connector surface reduces hub contamination and biofilm formation. Studies show clinically meaningful hub decontamination with passive caps.

**Evidence:**
- Menyhay & Maki (2006): IPA-filled caps reduced hub contamination in laboratory models
- Multiple clinical studies demonstrate CLABSI reductions when passive caps are added to standard scrub-the-hub practice (approximately 30–50% additional reduction in several studies)

**Cost-effectiveness:** Passive caps cost approximately $0.50–$1.00 per cap; cost-effectiveness is favorable given the high cost of CLABSI events.

**Implementation consideration:** Passive caps do NOT replace scrub-the-hub. They are an additive intervention. Do not change scrub-the-hub practice when implementing passive caps.

## Antimicrobial Lock Therapy (ALT)

Antimicrobial lock therapy involves instilling an antimicrobial solution into catheter lumens between uses, maintaining a bactericidal concentration within the catheter lumen throughout the interdialytic or inter-infusion interval.

### Indications

ALT is not routine practice for all CVAD patients. Evidence-based indications per IDSA 2009 and SHEA/IDSA 2022:

- **Long-term home infusion patients** (home TPN, home IV medications) with prior CLABSI history
- **Hemodialysis catheter patients** with persistent infection despite standard care
- **Immunocompromised patients** (stem cell transplant, hematologic malignancy) with CVADs and high infection risk
- **History of ≥2 CLABSI events** in a patient who cannot have the catheter removed

### ALT Solutions

| Solution | Target Organisms | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 70% Ethanol lock | Broad-spectrum; excellent for CoNS, biofilm | 4-hour lock; may degrade some catheter materials (verify with manufacturer) |
| Taurolidine-citrate | Broad-spectrum; anti-biofilm | Used in EU more than US; not widely commercially available in US |
| Vancomycin lock | Gram-positive (including MRSA) | Risk of resistance selection; limit to high-risk situations |
| Gentamicin-citrate | Gram-negative | Used for gram-negative CLABSI history |
| Minocycline-EDTA | Broad-spectrum | Anti-biofilm properties from EDTA chelation |

**Caution:** Antibiotic lock solutions carry risk of resistance selection, particularly with vancomycin. Non-antibiotic solutions (ethanol, taurolidine) are preferred when efficacy is adequate.

## Combining Interventions: Escalation Strategy

A rational escalation approach for persistent CLABSI:

**Tier 1 (all units):** Full insertion bundle + full maintenance bundle + CHG dressings + daily CHG bathing

**Tier 2 (if CLABSI > 2/1,000 despite Tier 1):** Add antimicrobial-impregnated catheters (CHG/SS or M/R) + passive disinfection caps on connectors

**Tier 3 (highest-risk or persistent rates):** Add ALT for highest-risk patients + review and remediate specific implementation failures (targeted audit, individual feedback, just-in-time education)

**Root cause analysis:** Every CLABSI event should trigger a root cause analysis to identify which bundle element failed and what system change is needed. CLABSI prevention is a quality improvement process, not a static protocol.
