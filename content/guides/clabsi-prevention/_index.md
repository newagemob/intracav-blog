# CLABSI Prevention: The Complete Evidence-Based Bundle

Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) is one of the most consequential healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in the United States. The CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) estimates more than **30,000 CLABSI events** occur annually in US hospitals, at an attributable cost of **$46,000–$68,000 per event** and a mortality rate of **12–25% in ICU settings**.

The evidence is unambiguous: the vast majority of CLABSI events are preventable. The landmark Michigan Keystone Project (Pronovost et al., 2006) demonstrated that consistent implementation of a five-element insertion bundle reduced ICU CLABSI rates by **66% within 18 months**, with median rates reaching zero at many institutions. Two decades of subsequent evidence confirm that near-elimination of CLABSI is an achievable goal.

This guide covers the complete CLABSI prevention framework: definitions and epidemiology, pathophysiology, the insertion and maintenance bundles, antimicrobial strategies, NHSN surveillance, and a step-by-step Zero CLABSI program implementation guide.

## What Is CLABSI?

**CLABSI (Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection)** is defined by the CDC/NHSN as a **primary laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infection** in a patient who had a central line in place on the date of the event or the day before, and the bloodstream infection is not related to an infection at another body site.

### CLABSI vs. CRBSI: A Critical Distinction

These terms are often used interchangeably in clinical settings but have important definitional differences:

| Term | Definition | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| **CLABSI** | Surveillance definition — presence of central line at or before BSI event; does not require proving the line as the source | Public health surveillance (NHSN); regulatory reporting; quality benchmarking |
| **CRBSI** (Catheter-Related BSI) | Clinical/microbiologic definition — requires proof of catheter as source (differential time-to-positivity, semiquantitative catheter culture, etc.) | Clinical research; individual patient diagnosis and treatment decisions |

For hospital quality programs and NHSN reporting, the CLABSI definition is used. For individual patient treatment decisions (e.g., whether to remove a catheter), the CRBSI framework guides clinical judgment.

### NHSN Surveillance Criteria

A CLABSI event is confirmed by NHSN criteria when:
1. A recognized pathogen is identified in one or more blood cultures, **AND** the organism is not related to an infection at another site; **OR**
2. A common commensal organism (e.g., coagulase-negative staphylococcus, viridans streptococcus) is identified in two or more blood cultures drawn on separate occasions within 2 days, **AND** the patient has a central line, signs/symptoms of infection, and the organism is not related to another infection site.

---

## Epidemiology and Healthcare Burden

### National Incidence

- NHSN estimates 30,000+ CLABSI events per year in US hospitals; the true number including outpatient CLABSI is higher
- CLABSI rates have declined approximately 50% since 2008, primarily driven by ICU bundle adoption — but rates have plateaued since 2016–2017
- **Non-ICU CLABSI now represents the majority of hospital CLABSI events** in many health systems, driven by PICC dwell in medical-surgical, oncology, step-down, and transitional care settings
- COVID-19 disrupted bundle compliance: NHSN data showed 28–47% CLABSI rate increases at some institutions during 2020–2021 peak pandemic periods

### Cost and Mortality

- Attributable cost per CLABSI event: **$46,000–$68,000** (2022 dollars) — driven by extended hospitalization (7–21 additional hospital days), additional antibiotic therapy, and management of septic complications
- Attributable mortality in ICU patients: **12–25%**
- CMS excludes CLABSI from reimbursable hospital-acquired conditions — facilities bear full treatment costs
- CLABSI is included in the CMS Hospital-Acquired Condition Reduction Program (HACRP), which can reduce Medicare payments by up to 1% for the lowest-performing quartile

### Prevention Potential

- IHI and Pronovost data: **70–90% of CLABSI events are preventable** with consistent bundle implementation
- The critical principle: bundles are all-or-nothing. Compliance with 4 of 5 elements provides minimal protective effect compared to complete compliance. Social accountability mechanisms (observer presence at insertion, daily public audit data) are key drivers of compliance.

## Pathophysiology of CLABSI

Understanding how organisms enter the bloodstream via catheter guides prevention strategy:

**Route 1: Extraluminal migration from insertion site skin** — Skin colonizing organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, gram-negative rods) migrate along the external catheter surface into the vascular space. Primary route for early-onset CLABSI (within first 10 days of catheter insertion). **Prevention: insertion bundle (CHG antisepsis, maximal sterile barrier), CHG-impregnated dressings.**

**Route 2: Intraluminal contamination from the hub** — Organisms enter via the needleless connector or catheter hub during access events. Primary route for late-onset CLABSI (after day 10, especially for long-term CVADs). **Prevention: maintenance bundle (scrub-the-hub protocol, needleless connector management).**

**Route 3: Hematogenous seeding** — Organisms from a distant infection site (e.g., urinary tract, pneumonia, wound) seed the catheter surface. Less common route. **Prevention: treating remote infections promptly; timely catheter removal when systemic infection is present.**

## CLABSI Risk Factors

Patient-level risk factors for CLABSI include:
- Immunosuppression (neutropenia, corticosteroids, chemotherapy, HIV/AIDS)
- Malnutrition and critical illness
- Prior CLABSI or line infection
- Parenteral nutrition (TPN is an independent CLABSI risk factor — glucose-rich and lipid-containing solutions support bacterial and fungal growth)
- Prolonged catheter dwell time
- Multiple concurrent access lumens

Device-level risk factors:
- Femoral vein CVC site (highest CLABSI risk among CVC sites — skin colonization, proximity to perineal flora)
- Multiple lumens (each additional lumen increases infection risk proportionally)
- Antimicrobial-coated vs uncoated catheter (uncoated associated with higher risk in high-risk populations)
- Non-tunneled vs tunneled device (tunneled catheters have lower infection rates for comparable dwell times)

## CLABSI Insertion Bundle

The CLABSI insertion bundle consists of five evidence-based practices that must be performed together, consistently, at every central venous catheter insertion. Compliance is verified by a real-time observer using a checklist.

### Component 1: Hand Hygiene

Perform hand hygiene using ABHR (alcohol-based hand rub) or soap and water **immediately before** any contact with the catheter, insertion site, or insertion equipment. Hand hygiene is the single most important infection prevention behavior in healthcare.

**Compliance failure pattern:** Hand hygiene is frequently observed to be omitted or performed inadequately when insertions occur under time pressure or with multiple distractions. Observer-enforced checklists improve compliance at this step.

### Component 2: Maximal Sterile Barrier (MSB) Precautions

MSB requires: **sterile gloves, sterile gown, cap, surgical mask, and large sterile drape** covering the patient from head to feet. MSB is required for all CVC, PICC, and tunneled catheter insertions regardless of clinical urgency (except true emergency resuscitation).

Evidence: Raad et al. (1994) demonstrated that MSB reduced CLABSI from 3.3 to 0.5 per 1000 catheter-days — a 7-fold reduction compared to sterile gloves and small drape alone. This remains one of the strongest single-element insertion bundle studies.

### Component 3: Chlorhexidine Gluconate (CHG) Skin Antisepsis

Cleanse the insertion site with **>0.5% CHG in alcohol** (standard preparation: 2% CHG / 70% isopropyl alcohol). Allow full contact time and drying before needle puncture.

- CHG is superior to 10% povidone-iodine (Betadine) for CLABSI prevention in adult patients
- For premature neonates (especially <26 weeks gestational age or birth weight <1,000g), CHG-alcohol antisepsis carries risk of chemical burns and systemic absorption — consult NICU protocol and consider aqueous CHG or aqueous povidone-iodine
- Alcohol must be allowed to fully dry (approximately 30 seconds) before catheter insertion; wet antiseptic does not provide full antimicrobial effect

### Component 4: Optimal Catheter Site Selection

- **Subclavian vein**: Preferred for non-tunneled CVC in adults — lowest CLABSI rate, lowest DVT risk; higher risk of pneumothorax during insertion than IJ
- **Internal jugular vein**: Preferred with ultrasound guidance; intermediate CLABSI risk
- **Femoral vein**: Highest CLABSI and DVT risk; reserve for situations where subclavian and IJ are inaccessible
- **Upper arm (basilic/brachial/cephalic) for PICC**: CLABSI rates generally lower than non-tunneled CVC during dwell; basilic preferred

Site selection for non-tunneled CVCs should be documented in the insertion note, with rationale if a site other than subclavian or IJ is used.

### Component 5: Daily Catheter Necessity Review

Every day, each central line must be assessed for continued clinical necessity. The question: **"Is this catheter still required for the patient's current care plan?"**

- Catheter necessity review is a core maintenance bundle element as well as an insertion bundle element (it should be ordered at insertion)
- Daily necessity review is the highest-leverage single action for reducing catheter-days and therefore CLABSI incidence
- Studies show that physician-ordered removal prompts and nurse-empowered removal protocols reduce catheter-days by 15–30% and CLABSI rates proportionally

## CLABSI Maintenance Bundle

The maintenance bundle addresses intraluminal contamination — the primary route for late-onset CLABSI — through disciplined hub management, dressing care, and daily assessment.

### Hub Disinfection: "Scrub the Hub"

At every catheter access event:
1. Scrub the needleless connector with **70% isopropyl alcohol** or **CHG-alcohol wipe** for **≥15 seconds**
2. Allow to **completely air dry** before accessing (approximately 15–30 seconds)
3. Access the connector only with sterile equipment

**Passive disinfection caps** (alcohol-impregnated port protectors) are an evidence-supported alternative that provides passive disinfection between access events and reduces active scrub-the-hub noncompliance. When used, they should be changed per manufacturer recommendations (typically 7 days or at each access).

### CHG-Impregnated Dressings

CHG-impregnated dressings (disc, gel, or sponge configurations) are applied at the insertion site beneath or incorporated into the transparent dressing. Meta-analyses demonstrate a **65–80% reduction in CLABSI** rates with CHG-impregnated dressings compared to standard TSM dressings (Ullman et al., 2016 Cochrane review).

INS 2021 Standard recommends CHG-impregnated dressings for all CVADs in patients ≥2 months of age unless contraindicated (CHG allergy, skin integrity compromised at site).

### CHG Bathing

Daily bathing with **2% CHG-impregnated cloths** or 4% CHG solution for eligible ICU patients reduces CLABSI by 23–36% (Climo et al., 2013, NEJM). CHG bathing is recommended by SHEA/IDSA (2022 update) as a standard preventive measure for adult ICU patients.

Contraindications: CHG allergy, open wounds over large body surface area, age <2 months (neonates).

### Needleless Connector Management

- Change needleless connectors per protocol (typically every 96 hours with administration set, or upon removal of set, or if contamination is suspected)
- Positive-displacement connectors are associated with higher CLABSI rates in some studies compared to neutral or negative-displacement connectors — institutional selection should be evidence-informed
- Disinfection caps provide passive disinfection when connector is not in use

---

## Antimicrobial Catheter Strategies

For patients in whom standard bundle compliance does not achieve acceptable CLABSI rates, antimicrobial catheters and dressings are a second-line prevention strategy.

Per CDC and IDSA guidance, antimicrobial catheters are indicated when:
- Institution's CLABSI rate remains above benchmark despite compliance with standard bundle
- Patient is at high individual risk for CLABSI (prolonged anticipated dwell, ICU, immunosuppression, TPN)

**Types of antimicrobial catheters:**
- **Chlorhexidine-silver sulfadiazine (CHG-SS)**: Impregnated on catheter external and internal surfaces; most evidence for short-term CVCs
- **Minocycline-rifampin (M/R)**: Shown to be superior to CHG-SS in some head-to-head trials; effective against a broader range of organisms including MRSA and gram-negatives
- **Silver-platinum-carbon-impregnated**: Less evidence; not recommended as first-line by current guidelines

## CLABSI Surveillance: NHSN Protocol

Accurate surveillance is the foundation of any CLABSI prevention program.

**Collecting catheter-days:** Count one catheter-day per patient per calendar day with a central line present, regardless of number of lines. Catheter-day denominators are collected by daily census or EHR data extraction.

**Rate calculation:** CLABSI events ÷ catheter-days × 1,000 = CLABSI rate per 1,000 catheter-days

**NHSN reporting:** Required monthly for all CMS-participating hospitals. Submit via NHSN Patient Safety Component — Device-Associated Module.

**Standardized Infection Ratio (SIR):** NHSN calculates a SIR comparing your observed CLABSI count to the predicted count based on your facility type and patient population. SIR <1.0 indicates better than predicted performance; SIR >1.0 indicates worse. CMS uses SIR for HACRP scoring.
