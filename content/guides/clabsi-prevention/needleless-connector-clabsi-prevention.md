# Needleless Connectors and CLABSI Prevention: Selection, Management, and Evidence

Needleless connectors (NLCs) are present on every CVAD, PIV, and midline catheter in clinical use. They are a primary access point for intraluminal contamination — every time a connector is accessed (for medication administration, blood draws, or flushing), there is an opportunity for microorganisms to enter the catheter lumen. Understanding needleless connector types, proper access technique, change management, and supplemental disinfection strategies is essential for CLABSI prevention.

## Why Connectors Matter for CLABSI

The catheter hub and needleless connector are the primary intraluminal contamination route for CLABSIs occurring after the first 3–5 days of catheter dwell. Unlike insertion-related CLABSIs (which are addressed by the insertion bundle), maintenance-related CLABSIs — the majority of long-dwell catheter infections — originate predominantly from hub contamination during access events.

Several CLABSI outbreaks have been directly traced to specific needleless connector products or improper connector management practices. The intraluminal pathway from connector access point → catheter lumen → bloodstream is a consistent mechanism in catheter infection pathogenesis.

## Needleless Connector Types

Understanding connector mechanics helps predict infection risk and guides selection decisions.

### Split-Septum Connectors

**Design:** A compressed rubber disc that splits open when a blunt cannula (Luer slip or Luer-lock) penetrates it. No mechanical valve.

**Fluid displacement:** Neutral — no fluid movement in or out of the catheter when the connector is accessed or disconnected.

**CLABSI risk:** Lower compared to mechanical valve connectors in observational data; simple internal architecture reduces biofilm accumulation sites.

**Example:** BD Q-Syte, Baxter Interlink.

### Mechanical Valve Connectors

**Design:** Internal valve mechanism (various designs) that opens when a Luer is inserted and closes when it is removed.

**Subtypes by fluid displacement:**
- **Positive displacement:** A small bolus of fluid is pushed INTO the catheter lumen when the Luer is disconnected. Theoretically reduces blood reflux into the catheter tip.
- **Negative displacement:** A small bolus of fluid is pulled BACK from the catheter lumen when the Luer is disconnected. Associated with blood reflux into catheter; higher thrombosis and CLABSI risk — negative displacement connectors should not be used with CVADs.
- **Neutral displacement:** No significant fluid movement on connection or disconnection.

**CLABSI risk:** Mechanical valve connectors with complex internal architecture have been associated with CLABSI outbreaks. The intricate internal pathways create surfaces for biofilm formation that are difficult to disinfect with scrub-the-hub alone. Positive-pressure mechanical valve connectors (PPMCs) in particular have been implicated in multiple outbreak investigations.

### Current Evidence on Connector Selection

Per SHEA/IDSA 2022 update: "Use needleless connectors with a simple mechanical design and that have been demonstrated in clinical trials to have low risk for intraluminal contamination."

**Practical guidance:**
- Split-septum connectors are generally preferred over mechanical valve connectors for CVAD use
- If mechanical valve connectors are used, select neutral displacement over positive or negative displacement
- Whatever connector type is selected, scrub-the-hub with every access is the single most important practice regardless of connector type

## Scrub-the-Hub: The Non-Negotiable Access Practice

### Standard

Before every access of a needleless connector (regardless of type):
1. Apply 70% IPA pad to the connector surface
2. Scrub with friction for **minimum 15 seconds**
3. Allow **15–30 seconds to dry**
4. Access immediately after drying

### Why Duration Matters

A 15-second scrub with friction achieves ≥3-log reduction in surface contamination. A 5-second scrub — the average observed duration in clinical audits — achieves only approximately 1-log reduction. The difference between adequate and inadequate scrub duration is a 100-fold difference in surface contamination.

**The friction component is essential.** Simply applying an alcohol pad without friction is insufficient. The mechanical scrubbing action physically removes organisms from connector surface crevices.

### Common Compliance Failures

- **Duration failure:** Most common. Clinicians self-estimate 15 seconds accurately only 30–40% of the time; they overestimate scrub duration.
- **Access before drying:** Accessing the connector before alcohol has evaporated recontaminates the surface and prevents maximum antiseptic effect.
- **Skipping scrub for urgent medications:** Every access, including urgent ones, requires a complete scrub. Build 30 seconds into urgent medication delivery workflows.
- **Using an IPA wipe once for multiple accesses:** Each port access requires a fresh, unused IPA pad.

## Connector Change Intervals

### INS 2021 Standard 37

- Change needleless connector **with each administration set change** (every 96 hours for continuous non-lipid infusions)
- Do not change connectors more frequently than every 72–96 hours without clinical indication
- Change immediately when:
  - Blood is visible in the connector body
  - Connector is cracked, damaged, or leaking
  - Contamination is suspected
  - Administration set is changed for any reason

### Why Not Change More Frequently?

Counterintuitively, more frequent connector changes may increase CLABSI risk by increasing the number of manipulation events. Each disconnection and reconnection event is an opportunity for contamination. Unless there is a specific clinical indication (contamination, blood in connector), the evidence does not support changing connectors more often than with administration set changes.

**Do not change connectors before surgery** unless clinically indicated — there is no evidence that pre-procedural connector changes reduce CLABSI.

## Passive Disinfection Caps

### What They Are

Passive disinfection caps are alcohol-impregnated port protectors that sit on needleless connector hubs between uses, providing continuous isopropyl alcohol contact.

**Products:** Curos Disinfecting Port Protector (70% IPA), SwabCap, 3M Curos Plus. Various connector-compatible designs.

**Mechanism:** Alcohol-saturated interior maintains continuous bactericidal contact with the connector surface throughout the cap's period of coverage (typically 7 days or until removed for access).

### Evidence

Multiple single-center and multi-center studies show that passive disinfection caps, when added to scrub-the-hub practice:
- Reduce hub contamination rates by 60–80% compared to scrub-the-hub alone
- Are associated with clinically meaningful CLABSI reductions in several published series

The SHEA/IDSA 2022 update acknowledges passive disinfection caps as an evidence-supported supplemental intervention.

### Implementation Considerations

**Caps do not replace scrub-the-hub.** When a passive cap is removed for access, perform scrub-the-hub before connecting. The cap maintains disinfection between uses; the scrub ensures safety at the moment of access.

**Connector compatibility:** Confirm that the cap brand is compatible with the institution's needleless connector brand. Cap size and thread compatibility varies; incorrect fit reduces alcohol contact and disinfection.

**Cost:** Approximately $0.50–1.50 per cap; when cap changes occur with each administration set change (every 96 hours), cost per catheter-day is manageable and cost-effective relative to CLABSI costs.

**Training:** Nursing staff need education on: how caps work, when to remove vs. leave caps in place, why scrub-the-hub is still required, and proper cap disposal.

## Anti-Reflux Connectors

Some connector designs incorporate anti-reflux mechanisms to prevent blood from entering the catheter tip (reducing thrombotic occlusion and potential intraluminal contamination from refluxed blood). The evidence for specific anti-reflux connector designs on CLABSI prevention is limited; the primary evidence-based benefit of SASH flushing with positive pressure technique addresses the same blood reflux problem.

## Connector Access Practices Summary

| Practice | Standard | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Scrub-the-hub | 15 seconds friction, 15–30s dry | Reduces hub surface contamination |
| Passive disinfection cap | Remove cap, scrub hub, access | Additive decontamination between uses |
| Connector change | With administration set (96h) | Balances replacement need vs. manipulation risk |
| Change for blood in connector | Immediately | Blood supports microbial growth in connector |
| Blunt Luer insertion | Perpendicular, non-rotating | Proper connector mating; avoids core damage |
| Flush before and after use | 10 mL NS pulsatile | Clears catheter lumen of debris and medication |
