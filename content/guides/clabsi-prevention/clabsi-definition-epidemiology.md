# CLABSI Definition, Epidemiology, and Surveillance: What Clinicians Need to Know

Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) is one of the most serious, costly, and largely preventable hospital-acquired infections. Despite decades of evidence-based prevention efforts, approximately 30,000–41,000 CLABSIs occur annually in US acute care hospitals, each carrying a 12–25% attributable mortality and $46,000–$68,000 in excess hospital costs.

Understanding how CLABSI is defined, measured, and reported is essential for every clinician involved in central venous access — from understanding the "why" behind prevention bundles to interpreting quality data at the unit level.

## CLABSI vs. CRBSI: A Critical Distinction

These two terms describe related but distinct concepts and are frequently confused.

### CRBSI (Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infection)

**CRBSI** is a **clinical and microbiologic diagnosis** used in research and for patient management decisions. CRBSI requires rigorous diagnostic criteria that include:
- Quantitative blood cultures showing ≥15 CFU from catheter tip (semiquantitative culture)
- **Or** differential time-to-positivity: blood cultures from catheter becoming positive ≥2 hours before peripheral cultures drawn simultaneously
- **Or** quantitative blood culture: catheter blood culture yield ≥3:1 ratio compared to peripheral culture

CRBSI is used in clinical trials and epidemiologic research because it establishes a definitive causal link between the catheter and the bacteremia.

### CLABSI (Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection)

**CLABSI** is a **surveillance definition** used by NHSN (National Healthcare Safety Network) and CMS for public reporting, quality benchmarking, and payment adjustment. CLABSI uses broader, more operationally accessible criteria:

A CLABSI event is defined as:
1. A laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infection (LCBI) — positive blood culture with an organism not consistent with a contaminant
2. **AND** a central line was in place for >2 calendar days at the time of the BSI event (or was removed the day before)
3. **AND** the BSI is not secondary to an infection at another recognized site

**Key difference from CRBSI:** CLABSI does not require proof that the catheter caused the bacteremia — only that a central line was present. This means:
- CLABSI is easier to measure at scale (no specialized diagnostics required)
- CLABSI overestimates true catheter causation (some "CLABSIs" would have occurred without the central line)
- CLABSI rates are appropriate for population-level surveillance and quality benchmarking, not individual patient diagnosis

## NHSN CLABSI Surveillance Criteria

### Central Line Definition (NHSN)

Per NHSN 2024 Patient Safety Component Manual: A central line is an intravascular catheter that terminates at or close to the heart or in one of the great vessels (SVC, IVC, pulmonary artery, or cardiac chamber). **The device must be used for infusion, withdrawal of blood, or hemodynamic monitoring.**

**Devices that are central lines for NHSN purposes:**
- PICC lines
- Non-tunneled CVCs (IJ, subclavian, femoral)
- Tunneled CVCs (Hickman, Broviac)
- Implanted ports
- Hemodialysis catheters (tunneled and non-tunneled)
- Umbilical venous catheters (UVC) and umbilical arterial catheters (UAC)

**Devices that are NOT central lines for NHSN purposes:**
- Peripheral IV catheters (PIV)
- Midline catheters (tip in axillary/subclavian vein — not a central vein)
- Intraosseous access devices

### LCBI Criteria (Bloodstream Infection Component)

NHSN defines three LCBI criteria:

**LCBI Criterion 1:** Patient has a recognized pathogen cultured from ≥1 blood culture, AND the pathogen is not related to an infection at another site.

**LCBI Criterion 2:** Patient has ≥1 symptom (fever, chills, hypotension) AND ≥2 positive blood cultures with a common skin commensal (e.g., coagulase-negative staph), AND cultures drawn on ≥2 separate occasions.

**LCBI Criterion 3:** (For patients ≤1 year of age): Similar criteria with age-specific symptom definitions.

## CLABSI Rate Calculation

### The Standard Formula

CLABSI Rate = (Number of CLABSI events / Number of central line-days) × 1,000

This produces a rate expressed as **events per 1,000 central line-days** — the standard unit for CLABSI reporting.

**Central line-days:** Each day that any patient in the unit has a central line in place counts as one central line-day. A patient with a PICC for 10 days contributes 10 central line-days.

**Example:** ICU with 500 central line-days and 2 CLABSI events:
CLABSI rate = (2 / 500) × 1,000 = **4.0 per 1,000 central line-days**

### Standardized Infection Ratio (SIR)

The **SIR** adjusts a facility's CLABSI rate for case mix and patient risk, enabling fair comparison across institutions of different types and sizes.

SIR = Observed CLABSI events / Predicted CLABSI events

**Predicted events** are calculated by NHSN using baseline data from a national reference period, adjusted for unit type (medical ICU, surgical ICU, medical ward, etc.).

**Interpretation:**
- SIR = 1.0: Observed CLABSIs equal to expected
- SIR < 1.0: Fewer CLABSIs than expected (better than predicted performance)
- SIR > 1.0: More CLABSIs than expected (worse than predicted performance)
- SIR = 0: Zero CLABSIs observed (aspirational target)

## CLABSI Epidemiology

### Incidence

- **US acute care hospitals:** Approximately 30,000–41,000 CLABSIs annually (HAI Progress Report 2022, CDC)
- **ICU rates:** 0.6–1.4 per 1,000 central line-days (2022 NHSN data, major ICU types)
- **Non-ICU inpatient rates:** 0.3–0.8 per 1,000 central line-days
- **NICU rates:** 0.5–1.9 per 1,000 central line-days (varies by birth weight category)

US CLABSI rates have declined approximately 50–70% from 2001 to 2020, attributed primarily to widespread adoption of evidence-based insertion and maintenance bundles. However, progress has stalled in recent years, and rates in some unit types have been rising post-COVID-19.

### Mortality

- **Attributable mortality:** 12–25% (varies by pathogen and patient population)
- **30-day all-cause mortality** in CLABSI events: 20–35% in ICU populations
- **Pathogens with highest mortality:** *Candida* spp. (mortality 30–50%); *Staphylococcus aureus* (mortality 20–30%); gram-negative rods (mortality 15–25%)

### Cost

- **Excess cost per CLABSI event:** $46,000–$68,000 (various published estimates; 2020 dollars)
- **Additional hospital days:** 7–21 excess days attributable to CLABSI
- **CMS non-payment:** CLABSI is a CMS non-reimbursable hospital-acquired condition — hospitals absorb the full cost
- **HACRP penalty:** CMS reduces Medicare payments by up to 1% for hospitals in the worst-performing quartile on HAI measures including CLABSI SIR

### Common Pathogens

Per NHSN data:
1. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) — most common overall, particularly in NICU
2. *Staphylococcus aureus* (including MRSA)
3. *Enterococcus* spp.
4. Gram-negative organisms (*Klebsiella*, *E. coli*, *Pseudomonas*)
5. *Candida* spp. (particularly in TPN patients, immunocompromised hosts)

## Pathogenesis: How Does CLABSI Happen?

Three primary routes of catheter infection:

**1. Extraluminal contamination (most common for short-term catheters):** Skin organisms at the insertion site migrate along the external catheter surface into the bloodstream. Insertion site asepsis (CHG antisepsis), maximal sterile barrier, and CHG dressings address this pathway.

**2. Intraluminal contamination (most common for long-dwell catheters):** Hub and connector contamination introduces organisms into the catheter lumen during access events. Scrub-the-hub, needleless connector changes, and ANTT address this pathway.

**3. Hematogenous seeding (less common):** Bacteremia from a distant site seeds the catheter surface. Prevention of other infections reduces this risk.

**Biofilm:** Once organisms establish on the catheter surface, they form a biofilm that protects them from antibiotics and host immune defenses. This is why antibiotic therapy alone rarely eradicates CLABSI — catheter removal is usually required.

## Why Zero Is Achievable

Several landmark programs have demonstrated that CLABSI can be eliminated:
- **Keystone ICU project** (Pronovost et al., 2006, *NEJM*): 103 Michigan ICUs reduced median CLABSI rate from 2.7 to 0 per 1,000 catheter-days
- **On the CUSP: Stop BSI:** Replicated Michigan results nationally across >1,000 hospital units
- **IHI Zero CLABSI program:** Evidence-based implementation framework translated bundle science into program design

The implication: most CLABSIs are preventable. The persistence of CLABSI events reflects implementation failures, not limits of clinical science.
