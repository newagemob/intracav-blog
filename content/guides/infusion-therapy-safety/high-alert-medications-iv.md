# High-Alert Medications in IV Therapy: Safety Standards and Clinical Protocols

High-alert medications are drugs that bear a heightened risk of causing significant patient harm when used in error. In IV therapy, high-alert medications warrant special safeguards because errors in concentration, rate, route, or patient identification can cause catastrophic, sometimes irreversible harm — cardiac arrest from hyperkalemia, fatal bleeding from heparin overdose, hypoglycemia from insulin infusion errors, respiratory arrest from opioid overdose.

The **Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP)** maintains the authoritative list of high-alert medications, and vascular access clinicians interact with these medications at every shift.

## The ISMP High-Alert Medication List (IV-Relevant)

ISMP publishes two high-alert medication lists: one for hospital settings, one for community/ambulatory settings. The hospital high-alert list includes medications with frequent or severe IV therapy-related errors.

### Concentrated Electrolyte Solutions

**Concentrated Potassium Chloride (KCl):**
- **Risk:** Inadvertent IV bolus of concentrated KCl causes fatal cardiac arrhythmia and cardiac arrest within minutes. Dozens of deaths annually result from KCl errors.
- **ISMP requirement:** Concentrated KCl (>2 mEq/mL solutions) should not be stored on patient care units (only in pharmacy). Pre-mixed KCl infusions (in bags) are dispensed to the floor.
- **Access requirement:** KCl >40 mEq/L requires central access (peripheral administration at these concentrations causes phlebitis and vascular injury)
- **Safe practice:** Always double-check KCl concentration and rate against the physician order before administering; independent double-check required for KCl drips at most institutions

**Concentrated Sodium Chloride (>0.9% NaCl):**
- 3% NaCl (hypertonic saline) requires central access — osmolarity ~1,026 mOsm/L far exceeds peripheral tolerance
- **Safe practice:** Hypertonic saline should only be administered as a controlled infusion — never a bolus. Rapid administration causes brain herniation and death in patients with hyponatremia (cerebral osmotic demyelination from rapid correction)

**Concentrated Sodium Phosphate:**
- Hyperphosphatemia from concentrated phosphate infusions can cause life-threatening hypocalcemia
- Always verify concentration; central access for concentrated formulations

### Anticoagulants

**Unfractionated Heparin (UFH):**
- **Risk:** Dosing errors in heparin infusions are among the most common serious medication errors in hospitals. Tenfold overdoses (10,000 units vs. 1,000 units) have been reported due to vial selection errors.
- **Safe practices:**
  - Standardize heparin concentrations in your institution (limited number of formulations)
  - Use weight-based heparin nomograms with mandatory pharmacist review
  - Independent double-check for all heparin infusion rate changes
  - Label all heparin drips with concentration and rate
  - Never use heparin flush vials for anticoagulant therapy — use only pharmacy-dispensed anticoagulation-dose heparin
- **Reversal:** Protamine sulfate 1 mg per 100 units UFH administered in preceding 4 hours

**Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH — enoxaparin, dalteparin):**
- Less common via IV route (most LMWH is subcutaneous)
- IV dalteparin (Fragmin) for hemodialysis anticoagulation requires dose verification

**Warfarin:**
- Oral, not IV — but hospital interactions with IV access patients (INR monitoring, dose adjustments, bridging with heparin) require awareness

**Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs):**
- Generally oral, not IV — but rivaroxaban, apixaban interactions with procedural considerations and catheter management are clinically relevant

### Insulin

**IV Regular Insulin (Insulin Drip):**
- **Risk:** Hypoglycemia from excess IV insulin causes brain injury and death. Errors in insulin infusion concentration, rate, and blood glucose monitoring protocol are common.
- **Safe practices:**
  - Standardized insulin infusion protocols with bedside blood glucose monitoring frequency
  - Independent double-check of insulin drip rate at initiation and with every rate change
  - Pharmacy prepares all insulin infusions (no bedside insulin preparation)
  - Never confuse insulin units with mL or mg — insulin is prescribed in UNITS
  - Separate insulin infusions from all other IV lines when possible

**Hypoglycemia treatment:** D50W (50% dextrose in water) requires central access at most institutions due to osmolarity (~2,525 mOsm/L); verify institutional policy.

### Opioids

**IV Opioid Infusions (morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl):**
- **Risk:** Opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD) is the primary risk. PCA (patient-controlled analgesia) opioid errors include accidental continuous infusion activation, inappropriate dose settings, and unauthorized use by family members.
- **Safe practices:**
  - Independent double-check of opioid concentration, rate, and PCA settings
  - Monitoring: respiratory rate, sedation scoring (POSS, Ramsay), pulse oximetry, capnography for high-risk patients
  - Naloxone immediately available on every unit where opioids are infused
  - See [Patient-Controlled Analgesia policy](/policies/patient-controlled-analgesia/) for full PCA safety framework

**Access considerations:** Opioid infusions do not themselves require central access on osmolarity grounds — standard opioid infusions are peripheral-compatible. However, PCA pumps are often co-located with other infusions in post-surgical patients who have CVADs.

### Neuromuscular Blocking Agents (NMBAs)

**Vecuronium, rocuronium, succinylcholine, cisatracurium:**
- **Risk:** NMBAs cause complete paralysis and respiratory arrest without affecting consciousness. A paralyzed patient who is not ventilated will die within minutes. NMBAs must NEVER be stored where nurses might accidentally select them instead of a sedative or antiemetic.
- **ISMP requirement:** NMBAs must be segregated from all other IV medications; labeled with tall-man lettering and bold warning labels; and accessible only in procedural areas or with pharmacist review
- **Safe practice:** Independent double-check for all NMBA administrations; always confirm patient is being mechanically ventilated or NMBA is being used under direct anesthesia supervision

### Chemotherapy

**All cytotoxic chemotherapy:**
- **Risk:** Chemotherapy agents have narrow therapeutic windows; overdoses cause life-threatening toxicities. Many are vesicants (see [Vesicant Administration Safety](/guides/infusion-therapy-safety/vesicant-administration-safety/)).
- **Safe practices:**
  - Central access required for all vesicant chemotherapy
  - Pharmacist verification of all chemotherapy orders (oncology pharmacy double-check)
  - Nurse independent double-check of drug name, dose, concentration, rate, and route before administration
  - Two-nurse independent double-check at many institutions for high-alert chemo agents
  - Antidote availability confirmed before administration begins

### Concentrated Dextrose Solutions

**D50W (50% dextrose), D20W, D10W:**
- D50W requires central access (osmolarity ~2,525 mOsm/L)
- D10W is borderline (osmolarity ~505 mOsm/L); central access preferred for continuous infusions
- Standard D5W is peripheral-compatible

## Required Safeguards for High-Alert IV Medications

**Independent double-check:** Two clinicians separately calculate and verify the drug, dose, concentration, rate, and route independently — then compare results. Required at most institutions for: insulin drips, heparin drips, concentrated KCl, NMBAs, chemotherapy.

**Smart pump drug error reduction systems (DERS):** Drug libraries in smart infusion pumps define acceptable drug-specific dose ranges. When a programmed rate exceeds the library limit, the pump generates a "hard" (override-blocked) or "soft" (override-allowed) alert. Smart pump DERS compliance is a TJC expectation.

**Pharmacist verification:** All high-alert medications should be verified by pharmacy before administration. Electronic pharmacy order review is standard in most US hospitals.

**Labeling:** High-alert medications should be labeled with auxiliary labels: "HIGH ALERT," "CAUTION: CONCENTRATED," "VERIFY DOSE BEFORE ADMINISTRATION."
