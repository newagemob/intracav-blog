# Infusion Therapy Safety: Clinical Standards and Best Practices

Infusion therapy is among the most complex and risk-laden clinical processes in healthcare. Every element of the infusion system — from the vascular access device to the administration set, from the pump to the needleless connector — represents a potential failure point. Medication errors involving IV medications are 2–3 times more likely to cause patient harm than errors involving oral medications, and IV-related adverse events represent a disproportionate share of preventable patient harm.

This guide covers the foundational safety standards for infusion therapy delivery: device and route selection for medications, filtration, flushing and locking protocols, vesicant management, high-alert medication safety, parenteral nutrition, and smart pump technology.

## The Infusion System: Components and Risk Points

Every infusion reaches a patient through a connected system of components:

1. **Vascular access device (VAD)** — peripheral or central; defines the route and osmolarity tolerance
2. **Extension set and add-on devices** — increase connection points; each is a potential contamination and disconnection risk
3. **Needleless connector (NLC)** — access point for every catheter entry; requires disinfection at every use
4. **Administration set** — tubing from infusate container to patient; harbors microorganisms if not changed per protocol
5. **Infusion pump** — dose delivery; drug library compliance is critical for high-alert medications
6. **Infusate container and medication** — preparation errors, compounding errors, and compatibility issues

The current clinical standards address each component. The principle: **minimize add-on devices to the minimum clinically required; every additional component adds infection risk, flow resistance, and potential failure.**

## Right Device for the Right Therapy

Device selection for infusion therapy must consider the osmolarity, pH, vesicant potential, volume requirements, and duration of the planned therapy.

### Osmolarity Thresholds 

| Osmolarity | Route |
|---|---|
| <600 mOsm/L | Peripheral IV acceptable (short term) |
| 600–900 mOsm/L | Central access strongly preferred |
| >900 mOsm/L | Central access required |
| TPN (typical) | Central access required (typically >900 mOsm/L) |

**Common medications exceeding peripheral thresholds:**
- Concentrated potassium chloride (>40 mEq/L)
- Mannitol 20%
- Phenytoin
- Acyclovir at concentrations >7 mg/mL
- Vancomycin at concentrations >5 mg/mL (also highly irritant)
- TPN without lipids

### pH Extremes

Medications with pH <5 or >9 cause chemical phlebitis at peripheral sites. Central access should be used for:
- Acyclovir (pH 11)
- Amphotericin B (pH 5–7 but highly irritant)
- Phenytoin (pH 12)
- Many chemotherapy agents

## High-Alert Medications via IV Access

The **Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP)** maintains a list of high-alert medications — drugs that bear a heightened risk of causing significant patient harm when used in error. Key IV high-alert medications include:

| Drug Class | High-Alert Risk | Key Safety Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| Concentrated electrolytes (KCl >20 mEq) | Fatal cardiac arrhythmia if administered undiluted | Never stock undiluted concentrated KCl on patient care units; require pharmacy-prepared dilutions |
| Heparin (all concentrations) | Hemorrhage, HIT | Weight-based protocol; independent double-check; use only pre-filled syringes |
| Insulin (IV infusions) | Hypoglycemia | Dedicated insulin drip protocol; glucose monitoring q1–2h; double-check required |
| Opioids (IV infusions, PCA) | Opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD) | Basal-rate restrictions; continuous oximetry or capnography for high-risk patients; naloxone availability |
| Neuromuscular blocking agents | Respiratory arrest if administered to non-intubated patient | Segregated storage; clear labeling ("Warning: Paralytic Agent — Causes Respiratory Arrest"); not stocked outside ICU/OR |
| Chemotherapy | Extravasation tissue necrosis; dose errors | Double-check protocol; ASCO/ONS safety standards; central access for vesicants |
| Hypertonic saline (>0.9%) | Osmotic demyelination if corrected too rapidly | Protocol-driven administration rate; nephrology or neurology consultation |

**Smart pump drug libraries:** ISMP recommends that all IV infusion pumps have **dose error reduction software (DERS)** with drug libraries covering high-alert medications. Hard limits (absolute maximum doses) should not be overrideable; soft limits (advisory alerts) should require documentation of clinical rationale to override. Annual drug library review is required.

## Filtration Standards

In-line filtration during IV infusion removes particulate matter, microorganisms, and air.  provides specific filtration guidance:

| Filter Size | Use Cases |
|---|---|
| **0.2 micron** | All IV medications where compatible; TPN without lipids; blood products (not applicable — use blood filter); most standard infusions |
| **1.2 micron** | Total parenteral nutrition with lipids (3-in-1 admixtures); lipid emulsions; blood and blood products (use specific blood filter with in-line screen) |

**Medications that cannot be filtered through 0.2 micron filter:**
- Lipid emulsions (particles are too large)
- Blood products (use 170–260 micron blood filter)
- Albumin (manufacturer guidance varies)
- Propofol (lipid-based; use 1.2 micron filter or in-line at pump)

**Neonatal filtration:** 0.2 micron filtration is particularly important in neonatal PN to reduce phlebitis risk in small, fragile veins and to filter potential particulate from compounded admixtures.

**Filter change frequency:**  — change filters with the administration set per the set change schedule (maximum 96 hours for continuous infusion); more frequently for lipid-containing solutions (24 hours).

See [Infusion Filtration Standards](/guides/infusion-therapy-safety/infusion-filtration-guide/).

## Flushing and Locking Protocols (SASH)

Consistent flushing and locking of vascular access devices prevents occlusion and reduces CLABSI risk by clearing the catheter of blood and infusate.

### The SASH Protocol

**SASH** (for heparin-locked CVADs):
1. **S** — Saline flush: 10 mL NS before medication administration (confirms patency)
2. **A** — Administration: administer medication or infusion
3. **S** — Saline flush: 10 mL NS after medication (clears the lumen)
4. **H** — Heparin lock: per institutional protocol (typically 10 units/mL, 3–5 mL)

**SASH-L** (saline-only lock): Use saline 0.9% 10 mL before and after when heparin lock is not indicated (e.g., Groshong-type valved PICC, some protocols).

### Flushing Technique

- Use **pulsatile (push-pause) technique**: alternating gentle pressure and release creates turbulent flow that is more effective at clearing the catheter lumen than steady continuous flush
- Use a **10 mL syringe minimum** to generate safe intraluminal pressure (smaller syringes can exceed catheter pressure ratings — a 1 mL syringe generates up to 1,000+ psi; a 10 mL syringe generates approximately 25–40 psi, within catheter specifications)
- **Positive pressure on final flush**: Maintain forward pressure on the syringe plunger while withdrawing the syringe to prevent blood reflux into the catheter lumen

### Heparin Lock Evidence

- Whether heparin or saline is superior for locking CVADs remains debated; meta-analyses show similar efficacy for both for patency maintenance in most CVAD types
- Saline lock is now recommended or preferred by many institutions (especially for short-term CVCs and PICCs) to reduce heparin exposure and HIT risk
- Heparin lock remains standard for implanted ports (per most manufacturer and institutional protocols) and for some tunneled catheter types
- the type and frequency of flushing/locking should be based on catheter manufacturer instructions, institutional protocol, and individual patient factors

## Administration Set Change Frequency 

| Infusion Type | Maximum Set Change Interval |
|---|---|
| Continuous infusion (non-lipid, non-blood, non-propofol) | Every 96 hours (4 days) |
| Intermittent infusion sets used continuously | Every 24 hours |
| Lipid-containing solutions (including 3-in-1 PN) | Every 24 hours |
| Blood and blood product sets | Within 4 hours of blood product start |
| Propofol infusions | Every 12 hours (or per manufacturer) |
| Dedicated peripheral IV sets used for intermittent dosing | Per institutional policy (typically 72–96h) |

**Never leave infusion sets in place beyond their scheduled change time.** Biofilm and microorganism colonization of administration set tubing increases with dwell time.

## Vesicant Administration Safety

A **vesicant** is a substance that, when extravasated into tissue, can cause blistering, tissue necrosis, and permanent injury. Safe vesicant administration requires:

1. **Central venous access for systemic vesicant infusions**: Peripheral IV administration of vesicants is associated with dramatically higher extravasation risk due to catheter movement, PIV failure rates, and smaller vessel diameter
2. **Pre-administration site assessment**: Confirm brisk blood return and easy flushing before initiating vesicant infusion
3. **Monitoring during infusion**: Assess site every 1–4 hours during vesicant infusion; immediately upon any patient report of pain, burning, or swelling at the site
4. **Extravasation response kit**: Must be immediately accessible on any unit administering vesicants; contents include antidotes, documentation forms, and emergency contacts
5. **Documentation**: Vesicant administration site, blood return confirmation, assessment findings, and any adverse events must be documented at each assessment

**Common vesicant drugs:**
- Anthracyclines: doxorubicin, daunorubicin, idarubicin, epirubicin
- Vinca alkaloids: vincristine, vinblastine, vinorelbine
- DNA-alkylating agents: mechlorethamine, cisplatin (concentrated)
- Taxanes: paclitaxel, docetaxel
- Vasopressors: norepinephrine, dopamine, vasopressin (in peripheral IV)

## Parenteral Nutrition (PN): Vascular Access Requirements

Parenteral nutrition is a complex, high-osmolarity admixture that requires specific vascular access considerations:

- **Osmolarity requiring central access**: PN solutions typically exceed 900 mOsm/L; standard-concentration TPN (20–25% dextrose + amino acids) must be administered via central access
- **Peripheral parenteral nutrition (PPN)**: Lower-osmolarity PN formulations (<600–900 mOsm/L) can be administered peripherally; suitable only for short-term supplemental PN; high phlebitis rate
- **Dedicated lumen**: PN should have a dedicated catheter lumen when possible; incompatibility with many medications and blood products; risk of contamination with multi-access lumens
- **Filtration**: 1.2 micron filter for 3-in-1 (all-in-one with lipids); 0.2 micron filter for dextrose-amino acid only (no lipids)
- **DEHP-free tubing**: Required for neonatal PN (DEHP plasticizers leach from standard PVC tubing in the presence of lipids; DEHP is an endocrine disruptor; significant concern in preterm neonates)
- **Light protection**: Neonatal PN with multivitamins (vitamin A) requires light-protected tubing and bags; vitamin A degrades rapidly under phototherapy light

See [Parenteral Nutrition Vascular Access Requirements](/guides/infusion-therapy-safety/parenteral-nutrition-vascular-access/).

## Smart Pump Technology and DERS

**Dose Error Reduction Software (DERS)** in smart IV pumps is one of the most effective tools for preventing IV medication errors. Requirements:

- All high-alert medications should be covered in the drug library with clinical dose limits
- **Hard limits** should define the absolute upper boundary; hard limit overrides are not permitted
- **Soft limits** generate advisory alerts but can be overridden with documentation; soft limit compliance rates should be tracked (high override rates indicate need for library adjustment)
- Annual drug library review and update is required per Joint Commission
- DERS compliance rates (% of infusions programmed from library vs. free-form programming) should be monitored as a quality metric
