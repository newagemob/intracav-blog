# Ultrasound-Guided PICC Insertion: Complete Procedural Guide

Ultrasound guidance for PICC insertion is the standard of care and virtually universal in professional PICC practice. It dramatically reduces complications: first-attempt insertion success rates increase from approximately 70% (landmark) to >95% (US-guided), inadvertent arterial puncture rates drop from ~5% to <1%, and catheter-to-vein ratio can be accurately assessed before catheter selection.

This guide focuses specifically on the ultrasound components of PICC insertion — vein survey, basilic vein cannulation technique (long-axis preferred), guidewire confirmation, and integration with ECG tip guidance.

## Pre-Insertion Vein Survey

A systematic pre-insertion US survey of both upper extremities is the most valuable pre-PICC assessment tool. Performed before consent, before equipment setup, and before skin preparation.

### Survey Protocol

**Equipment:** Linear US probe (10–15 MHz), non-sterile gel, tourniquet.

**Patient position:** Supine, arm abducted 45–90°. Apply tourniquet to mid-upper arm.

**Scan each vein bilaterally (if no laterality contraindication):**

1. **Basilic vein** at mid-upper arm: transverse view; measure inner lumen diameter; assess compressibility; check for thrombosis (incompressibility, intraluminal echogenicity)
2. **Brachial veins**: identify adjacent to brachial artery; measure
3. **Cephalic vein**: lateral upper arm; measure
4. **Axillary vein**: scan proximal to the basilic entry point; confirm patency

**Document for each target vessel:**
- Vessel name
- Diameter (mm)
- Depth from skin surface (mm)
- Presence of thrombus: yes/no
- Compressibility: complete/partial/absent

### What to Look for in the Survey

**Adequate PICC target:**
- Diameter ≥3 mm (preferred ≥4 mm)
- Compressible (no thrombosis)
- No adjacent artery in immediate proximity to planned needle path
- Accessible at a stable site (away from flexion points)

**Disqualifying findings:**
- Non-compressible vessel (DVT) — do not place PICC in a vessel with DVT
- Diameter <2.5 mm — catheter-to-vein ratio will be excessive for any standard PICC
- Superficial thrombophlebitis or skin infection at planned insertion site

**Side selection:** Right arm preferred (direct path to SVC without navigating left brachiocephalic curve). If bilateral options are equivalent, choose right. If right side has smaller vessels, contraindication, or DVT, proceed with left.

## Catheter-to-Vein Ratio Assessment

Once target vein is identified:

1. Measure the vein inner lumen diameter in transverse view at the planned insertion site
2. Identify the smallest-gauge PICC that meets clinical lumen count requirement
3. Check manufacturer's outer diameter for that catheter
4. Calculate: (Catheter OD / Vein inner diameter) × 100 = catheter-to-vein ratio (%)
5. **Target: ≤45%**

**Example:** 4 Fr double-lumen PICC (outer diameter ~1.7 mm) in a basilic vein measuring 4.5 mm inner diameter:
1.7 / 4.5 × 100 = 38% ✓ (acceptable)

If ratio exceeds 45%, choose a smaller PICC or target a larger vein; reconsider whether single-lumen catheter is sufficient.

## Long-Axis (In-Plane) Technique for Basilic Vein Cannulation

### Why Long-Axis for PICC

For PICC insertion — unlike peripheral PIV where speed and a small footprint are priorities — the long-axis technique is preferred because:
- The needle must advance a longer path to the basilic vein (often 1–3 cm deep)
- Needle tip visualization along the full path reduces inadvertent vessel wall puncture
- The brachial artery and median nerve are in close proximity; real-time tip confirmation is safer
- After vein entry, the guidewire advancement can also be confirmed in the same long-axis view

### Technique

**Setup:**
- Sterile probe cover and sterile gel (PICC is a sterile procedure with maximal sterile barrier)
- Linear probe; set depth to 3–4 cm for most upper arm veins
- Identify basilic vein in transverse view first to confirm patency and depth
- Rotate probe to long-axis (parallel to vessel): the vessel appears as an elongated channel

**Needle approach:**
- Enter skin from the short end of the probe footprint
- Approach angle: 20–30° (shallower than PIV because the needle must travel a long path through tissue to reach a deep vessel)
- The needle should appear as a bright hyperechoic line running along the vessel in the long-axis view

**Advancing to the vessel:**
- Walk the needle through the tissue layers visible on screen: skin, subcutaneous fat, fascia, then vessel wall
- The needle tip touching the anterior wall of the vessel produces a characteristic "tenting" of the vessel wall before puncture
- Upon puncture, the needle tip appears to "pop" through the anterior vessel wall into the dark vessel lumen

**Guidewire advancement (confirm on US):**
- After blood return: advance guidewire 15–20 cm
- If available, confirm guidewire in vessel with US: the guidewire is highly echogenic (bright white) — it should be visible as a bright line within the vessel lumen on long-axis view
- **Critical check:** Confirm the guidewire is in the vein, not the adjacent brachial artery — artery and vein are close in this region; confirm with compressibility and color Doppler

## Integrating ECG Tip Guidance

After the catheter is advanced to pre-measured length:

**ECG guidance systems (Sherlock 3CG, PALMS):**
- The ECG intravascular electrode (in the saline-filled catheter or guidewire) displays P-wave amplitude
- Maximum upright P-wave = CAJ position
- As catheter is advanced past the CAJ: P-wave begins to invert

**Procedure:**
1. Advance catheter to 2–3 cm short of pre-measured length
2. Activate ECG guidance system; observe P-wave on monitor
3. Slowly advance catheter until P-wave reaches maximum amplitude (equal to or greater than surface lead amplitude)
4. Note catheter position at maximum P-wave; this is the CAJ — confirm external catheter length
5. If P-wave begins to invert: catheter is in the RA — withdraw 1–2 cm

**Documentation:** Record P-wave characteristics in insertion note (e.g., "P-wave maximum at 42 cm; no inversion; ECG confirmation of CAJ position").

**For AF patients:** ECG guidance is unreliable — obtain post-procedure CXR.

## Managing Common Ultrasound-Specific Challenges

### Losing the Vessel During Insertion

**Problem:** The vessel goes out of view during needle advancement.

**Solutions:**
- Slow down — rapid probe movements cause the vessel to "escape" from the image
- Maintain gentle probe pressure (too much pressure collapses the vein)
- Use the vessel's position landmarks to re-identify (the artery should be adjacent)
- Scan in short-axis to re-identify the vein, then return to long-axis

### Guidewire Coils at the Shoulder

**Problem:** Guidewire will not advance past the subclavian/cephalic junction or meets resistance at the shoulder.

**This is not an ultrasound issue but occurs frequently with upper arm PICC.** The cephalic vein has a torturous junction with the axillary vein. Solutions:
- Internal rotation of the arm (turn palm to face bed)
- Abduction of the arm to 90° or beyond
- Have patient turn head toward the insertion arm (blocks IJ entry)
- If resistance persists: withdraw guidewire 5–10 cm; reposition arm; re-advance

### US-Guided Verification of Deep Vessel

**Problem:** Very deep target vein (>2 cm) — needle visualization is poor.

**Solutions:**
- Increase depth setting on US (to 5–6 cm)
- Use lower gain initially to reduce echo clutter
- Switch to short-axis (out-of-plane) technique and "walk" the bright dot to the vessel
- Hydrolocation: inject 0.5 mL NS and watch for turbulence in vessel
