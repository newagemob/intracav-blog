# Ultrasound-Guided Vascular Access: Clinical Reference

Ultrasound guidance has fundamentally transformed the safety and success of vascular access procedures over the past two decades. For PICC insertion, real-time ultrasound guidance is now standard of care. For central venous catheter insertion, NICE guidelines (2002) established ultrasound as the preferred approach for internal jugular CVC placement. For peripheral IV access in difficult-access patients, ultrasound guidance dramatically improves first-stick success.

This guide covers the complete clinical scope of ultrasound-guided vascular access: the evidence base, relevant vascular anatomy, ultrasound technique, application to each device type, tip confirmation, and the training and credentialing requirements for safe practice.

## Evidence Base

### Ultrasound for Central Venous Catheter Insertion

- **NICE Technology Appraisal 49 (2002)**: Landmark guidance establishing real-time 2D ultrasound as the preferred method for elective insertion of CVCs into the internal jugular vein, based on systematic review evidence showing 57% reduction in failed placements and 71% reduction in arterial puncture
- **Cochrane review (Brass et al., 2015)**: Confirmed ultrasound guidance reduces failed placement, arterial puncture, hematoma, and pneumothorax for IJ CVC insertion
- **Parienti et al. (2015, NEJM)**: Randomized trial of 3,027 CVC insertions demonstrating ultrasound guidance significantly reduced complications for IJ and subclavian approaches
- **ASA/SCCM/ACCP consensus**: Ultrasound guidance recommended for all elective central venous cannulation procedures where equipment and trained operators are available

### Ultrasound for PICC Insertion

- All major clinical guidelines (, AVAR, SHEA/IDSA) require or strongly recommend real-time ultrasound guidance for PICC insertion
- Ultrasound guidance for PICC insertion allows: optimal vein selection (size, depth, absence of thrombosis), real-time needle visualization, micropuncture technique facilitation, reduction of nerve injury risk
- Without ultrasound, PICC insertion failure and complication rates are substantially higher

### Ultrasound for Peripheral IV Access

- **DIVA trial and subsequent studies**: Real-time ultrasound guidance for difficult-access patients (DIVA score ≥3 or ≥4 depending on criteria) improves first-stick success rates from 40–60% (standard technique in difficult access) to 80–90%
- **Pediatric literature**: Strong evidence for ultrasound-guided PIV in pediatric patients with difficult access; reduces traumatic attempts and procedural distress
- The long-axis technique with a minimum 2.5 cm catheter length in the vein is associated with lower failure and dislodgment rates for ultrasound-guided PIV

## Vascular Anatomy for Ultrasound

Understanding relevant vascular anatomy is foundational to safe ultrasound-guided vascular access. The clinician must be able to identify target veins, distinguish veins from arteries, recognize anatomic variants, and avoid adjacent structures (arteries, nerves, pleura).

### Upper Extremity Veins (PICC and Difficult PIV)

- **Basilic vein**: Largest and most superficial of the upper arm medial veins; preferred for PICC insertion (straightforward path to axillary → subclavian → SVC, minimal tortuosity); runs medially on the upper arm; easily compressed; mean diameter 4–5 mm in most adults
- **Brachial veins**: Paired deep veins adjacent to the brachial artery; often used when basilic is inadequate in size or absent; care required to avoid the adjacent brachial artery and median nerve
- **Cephalic vein**: Runs laterally on the upper arm; smaller than basilic; higher rate of PICC malposition at the cephalic-subclavian angle (narrow, acute angle); used when basilic and brachial are unavailable
- **Basilic vs. brachial vs. cephalic**: Basilic preferred first choice; brachial second; cephalic last resort due to higher malposition risk

**Distinguishing veins from arteries on ultrasound:**
- **Compressibility**: Veins collapse with gentle transducer pressure; arteries do not (the most reliable sign)
- **Pulsatility**: Arteries pulse with cardiac cycle; veins do not (unless severe tricuspid regurgitation or high right heart pressures)
- **Doppler signal**: Arteries show high-resistance pulsatile waveform; veins show phasic flow with respiration
- **Wall thickness**: Arteries have thicker, echogenic walls; vein walls are thin

### Internal Jugular Vein (CVC Insertion)

- Runs lateral to the carotid artery, deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle
- Best visualized with patient supine, neck slightly extended, head turned slightly contralateral
- Average IJV diameter: 8–12 mm in most adults; enlarges with Valsalva
- Carotid artery lies medial and deep — it is pulsatile and non-compressible on ultrasound

### Subclavian/Axillary Vein

- The axillary vein transitions to the subclavian vein at the first rib; the subclavian vein is used for non-tunneled CVCs and is increasingly used for US-guided infraclavicular access
- The infraclavicular approach allows ultrasound visualization of the axillary-subclavian junction

## Ultrasound Equipment

**Transducer selection:** Use a **high-frequency linear transducer** (7–15 MHz) for vascular access. Higher frequency (10–15 MHz) provides excellent near-field resolution for superficial veins (PIV, PICC approach). Lower frequency (7–10 MHz) may be needed for deeper structures (subclavian, obese patients).

**Probe preparation for sterile procedures:**
- Use a sterile probe cover (commercially available kits) for all insertions requiring maximal sterile barrier (PICC, CVC)
- Apply sterile ultrasound gel inside the probe cover and at the skin interface
- Non-sterile probe covers with sterile gel at the skin may be acceptable for non-sterile field PIV insertions (per institutional policy)

**Machine settings:**
- Select the vascular access or peripheral vascular preset
- Adjust depth and gain for optimal vein visualization (vein should occupy approximately 1/3 to 1/2 of the screen in depth)
- Adjust focal zone to the depth of the target vein

## Ultrasound Technique

### Short-Axis (Transverse) Technique

The probe is oriented **perpendicular to the vessel** (cross-sectional view). The vein appears as a dark (anechoic) circle.

**Advantages:** Easy vein identification; ability to see surrounding structures simultaneously; popular for teaching.

**Disadvantages:** Needle tip can be confused with the needle shaft — only the structure in the imaging plane is visible; risk of "missing" the needle and penetrating the posterior vessel wall without realizing.

**Technique:**
1. Center the vein in the short-axis view
2. Insert needle at a point that will allow it to enter the imaging plane at the center of the vein
3. Advance needle, watching for tissue tenting as needle approaches vessel
4. Confirm needle tip in vessel lumen (blood flash) before threading catheter/guidewire

### Long-Axis (Longitudinal) Technique

The probe is oriented **parallel to the vessel** (longitudinal view). The vein appears as a dark tube running the length of the image.

**Advantages:** Full needle visualization from tip to hub (in-plane technique); eliminates "where is the needle tip?" problem; allows confirmation of catheter in-plane threading.

**Disadvantages:** More technically demanding; surrounding structures less visible; thin longitudinal window requires precise probe alignment.

### In-Plane vs. Out-of-Plane

- **In-plane**: Needle is parallel to the long axis of the probe; the entire needle length is visible in the image (long-axis technique achieves this)
- **Out-of-plane**: Needle crosses the imaging plane perpendicular; only a cross-section of the needle appears (short-axis technique is typically out-of-plane)

**Expert consensus:** For PICC insertion, the long-axis technique with in-plane needle visualization is increasingly preferred — allows visual confirmation of wire and catheter advancement within the vessel.

## Ultrasound for Peripheral IV Placement

Ultrasound-guided PIV is most beneficial for patients with DIVA (Difficult Intravenous Access):

**DIVA indicators for US-guided PIV:**
- History of difficult IV access
- No visible veins on inspection
- No palpable veins in antecubital and forearm
- DIVA score ≥3 (per validated scoring tool)
- Multiple failed standard IV attempts (typically ≥2)

**Technique for US-guided PIV:**
- Use a high-frequency linear probe (10–15 MHz)
- Target the **basilic, cephalic, or brachial vein** in the forearm or antecubital region
- Long-axis technique preferred to maximize catheter-in-vessel visualization
- **Catheter length minimum**: Use a **minimum 2.5 cm (1 inch) catheter** for US-guided PIV; preferably ≥3.5–4.8 cm (1.75–2 inch) for deep veins to ensure adequate intravascular catheter length after insertion
- Standard 18G–20G polyurethane catheter is adequate; catheter-over-needle design used
- Document US guidance in EHR: vein accessed, depth, technique, catheter length used

See [Ultrasound for Difficult Peripheral IV Access](/guides/ultrasound-guided-vascular-access/ultrasound-peripheral-iv-difficult-access/).

## Ultrasound for PICC Insertion

Real-time ultrasound guidance is standard of care for PICC insertion. The complete step-by-step protocol is covered in [Ultrasound-Guided PICC Insertion](/guides/ultrasound-guided-vascular-access/ultrasound-picc-insertion-guide/).

Key points:
- Scan both arms before site selection; document the chosen vein (basilic first choice)
- Apply sterile probe cover before making the sterile field
- Use long-axis technique for PICC insertion to visualize needle, wire, and peel-away sheath advancement within the vein
- Limit insertion attempts; if unable to access basilic, reassess brachial and cephalic before abandoning the procedure

---

## Ultrasound for CVC Insertion

For IJ CVC:
- Patient position: supine, neck slightly extended, head turned slightly contralateral; Trendelenburg position dilates the IJ
- Identify IJ in short-axis; confirm compressibility; locate carotid artery (medial, non-compressible)
- Standard short-axis technique: center IJ, insert needle, advance until blood flash
- Confirm guidewire in IJ (not carotid) before dilation — use long-axis view to see wire in vessel, or use Doppler to confirm non-pulsatile guidewire path
- Post-insertion CXR mandatory for all non-tunneled CVCs to confirm tip position and rule out pneumothorax

---

## Intraprocedural Tip Confirmation

Ultrasound can detect guidewire or catheter in the right atrium during PICC advancement, providing basic proximity guidance. However, **dedicated intraprocedural ECG guidance systems** (Sherlock 3CG, MIRUS, Nautilus) are the standard for intraprocedural PICC tip confirmation, with 95–98% accuracy for CAJ placement vs. 81–89% for CXR-only approaches.

Ultrasound of the heart (subxiphoid view) can also demonstrate guidewire or catheter agitation in the right atrium in real time — a technique used by some interventionalists when ECG guidance is unavailable.

## Training, Competency, and Credentialing

All clinicians using ultrasound for vascular access procedures require documented training and competency validation. and AVAR standards:

**PICC inserters:**
- Minimum training: didactic education on US physics, anatomy, technique + supervised procedures with ultrasound
- Competency validation: observed proficiency with US-guided PICC placement

**Ultrasound-guided PIV:**
- Training: brief didactic + supervised insertions
- Institutions should define minimum supervised cases for competency

**CVC with ultrasound:**
- Typically credentialed as part of physician/APP procedural privileges; requirements vary by institution

See [Ultrasound Credentialing Requirements](/guides/ultrasound-guided-vascular-access/ultrasound-credentialing-requirements/) and [Vascular Access Credentialing](/guides/vascular-access-credentialing/) for full frameworks.
