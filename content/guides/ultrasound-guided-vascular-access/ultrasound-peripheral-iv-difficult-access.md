# Ultrasound-Guided Peripheral IV for Difficult Access: DIVA Score and Technique

Difficult intravenous access (DIVA) affects approximately 10–24% of hospitalized patients who need peripheral IV placement. In these patients, standard landmark-and-palpation technique fails at high rates (>60% first-attempt failure for DIVA score ≥4), leading to multiple painful attempts, patient distress, vein damage, and unnecessary escalation to central access. Ultrasound-guided peripheral IV placement transforms this situation — achieving >80% first-attempt success rates in DIVA patients and reducing the progression to unnecessary PICC placements.

## The DIVA Score: Predicting IV Access Difficulty

The **DIVA (Difficult Intravenous Access)** score, validated by Egan et al. (2012), identifies patients at high risk for failed standard PIV placement:

| Criterion | Score |
|---|---|
| History of difficult IV access (patient reports or documented) | 1 |
| No visible veins in the antecubital fossa | 1 |
| No palpable veins in the antecubital fossa | 1 |
| Current or prior IV drug use | 2 |

**Score interpretation:**
- **0–1:** Standard PIV approach; low probability of failure
- **2–3:** Consider ultrasound guidance for PIV or escalation to midline
- **≥4:** High probability of failed standard PIV; escalate to US-guided PIV, midline, or PICC consultation

### How to Apply DIVA Score in Practice

1. When a PIV order is received, perform a brief visual and palpation assessment before attempting placement
2. If antecubital veins are not visible and not palpable (DIVA ≥2), use ultrasound before attempting
3. Document DIVA score in the nursing note or IV assessment
4. DIVA ≥4 patients should go directly to US-guided approach — do not attempt standard PIV and document failures first (except in emergencies)

**VEIN-Q score** (an alternative validated tool) incorporates similar criteria and may be used at institutions that have standardized on that assessment.

## Vein Selection for US-Guided PIV

### Target Vessels (Preferred to Least Preferred)

**Forearm veins (best for PIV):**
- Median antebrachial vein (central forearm)
- Lateral forearm veins
- Medial forearm basilic tributaries

**Antecubital fossa veins (acceptable but position risk):**
- Median cubital vein
- Median basilic vein
- Note: AVs in the antecubital fossa are at high risk for positional occlusion with elbow flexion — use with awareness of this limitation

**Upper arm veins (last-choice for PIV, but accessible with US):**
- Brachial vein (in proximity to brachial artery and median nerve — caution)
- Basilic vein in the upper arm (suitable; larger but deeper)

**Avoid:**
- Wrist and hand veins — higher phlebitis rate, patient discomfort, positional issues
- Foot and leg veins (adults) — use only if all other options exhausted; high DVT risk
- Antecubital when dexterity is required (elbow flexion occludes the IV)

### Vein Criteria for US-Guided PIV

**Minimum diameter:** ≥3 mm (inner lumen diameter on US transverse view). Veins <3 mm in diameter are typically too small to reliably cannulate with a standard 20G PIV catheter using US guidance.

**Depth:** The target vein should be accessible to a standard-length PIV catheter:
- For veins ≤0.6 cm deep: standard 3/4" to 1" PIV catheter is adequate
- For veins 0.6–1.5 cm deep: use longer catheter (1.88" or 2.5" over-the-needle catheter, or long-line PIV)
- For veins >1.5 cm deep: a standard PIV catheter will not remain in the vessel after the needle is removed (catheter length doesn't reach the lumen); escalate to midline or PICC

**Catheter-to-vein ratio consideration for US PIV:** For longer-dwell access, ensure the vein is ≥2–3 mm larger than the catheter outer diameter to reduce phlebitis risk.

## Catheter Length Requirements

This is the most commonly misunderstood aspect of US-guided PIV placement. When a vein is visualized with ultrasound, the depth determines which catheter length is appropriate:

**The "one-third rule" (practical guideline):**
At least one-third of the catheter must remain within the vein after insertion for the catheter to remain intraluminal with normal patient movement. If a vein is 2 cm deep and you use a 1" (2.5 cm) catheter: 1 cm enters the vein, 1.5 cm is in tissue — inadequate retention. For 2 cm deep vein, use a 3-inch (7.5 cm) long-line catheter.

**Catheter lengths available:**
- Standard PIV: 3/4" (2 cm), 1" (2.5 cm), 1.25" (3 cm), 1.5" (3.8 cm)
- Extended-length peripheral catheters: 1.88" (4.8 cm), 2.5" (6.4 cm)
- Long-line peripheral catheters: 3" (7.5 cm), 4.5" (11 cm)

**Practical implication:** For deep veins accessible only with ultrasound (typically 1.5–3 cm deep), you need extended-length catheters. Standard 1-inch PIV catheters are inadequate. Ensure your team has appropriate longer catheters in stock before implementing US PIV programs.

## US-Guided PIV Technique (Short-Axis, Dynamic)

### Equipment Setup

- Linear US probe (7.5–15 MHz)
- Non-sterile gel (for PIV — not a sterile procedure)
- Target catheter with appropriate length for vessel depth
- Tourniquet, alcohol wipe, tape/dressing, flush

### Procedure

**1. Apply tourniquet and scan:**
- Place tourniquet on upper arm for forearm/antecubital access
- Apply gel to probe; scan in transverse (short-axis) view
- Identify target vein: confirm compressibility, measure diameter and depth
- Confirm no artery immediately adjacent to the planned needle path

**2. Mark the target (optional):**
- Mark the skin overlying the center of the target vein with a skin marker
- Note the depth to inform catheter length selection

**3. Position probe and needle:**
- Hold probe with non-dominant hand
- Advance needle from one side of the probe at 30–45° angle toward the vessel
- The needle indicator on the probe side closest to the needle entry will help maintain orientation

**4. Advance under real-time guidance:**
- Watch the US screen while advancing the needle
- The needle appears as a bright dot on the transverse image
- "Chase" the needle tip with the probe — keep the bright dot centered on the target vessel
- When the bright dot is centered on the vessel and then "disappears" into the dark vessel lumen, the tip has entered the vessel

**5. Confirm access:**
- Look for blood flashback in the catheter hub
- Advance the guidewire or advance-on-needle catheter design into the vessel

**6. Thread catheter:**
- While maintaining needle in vessel, lower the needle angle to 10–15° to thread catheter along the vessel
- Advance catheter to appropriate depth (at minimum 2/3 of catheter length in vessel)
- Remove needle; confirm no resistance to flush

**7. Confirm position:**
- Apply saline flush: catheter should flush without resistance; no swelling at site
- If available, confirm with long-axis US view showing catheter in vessel lumen

### Common Pitfalls

**Tracking shaft instead of tip:** The most common error. Solution: jiggle the needle; trace the echogenic structure from probe entry to confirm it is needle.

**Losing vessel from view:** The vessel "jumps" off-screen when probe is tilted. Solution: practice probe stabilization; use smaller probe movements.

**Insufficient catheter length:** Standard 1-inch catheter used for deep vessel. Solution: always measure vessel depth before selecting catheter.

**Arterial puncture:** Usually from inadequate compressibility testing before needle insertion. Solution: always perform compressibility test; confirm non-pulsatile on color Doppler.

## When to Escalate Beyond US-Guided PIV

US-guided PIV is not always the answer. Escalate to midline or PICC consultation when:

- Vein diameter <3 mm or depth >2 cm with no appropriate extended catheter available
- Three failed US-guided PIV attempts by experienced clinician
- Therapy duration expected >5–7 days (PICC/midline more appropriate than repeated PIV access)
- Therapy osmolarity or pH requires central access (no amount of peripheral access skill makes a PIV appropriate for TPN)
- DIVA score ≥4 AND therapy duration >1 week AND no adequate veins on US survey → go directly to midline/PICC consultation without attempting PIV
