# Catheter-Associated Thrombosis: Upper Extremity DVT and Fibrin Sheath Management

Catheter-associated thrombosis is the most common non-infectious complication of central venous access devices. It ranges from asymptomatic fibrin deposition (nearly universal with prolonged dwell) to symptomatic upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (UEDVT) requiring anticoagulation. Understanding the spectrum, risk factors, diagnostic approach, and treatment decision framework is essential for any clinician managing CVADs.

## The Thrombosis Spectrum

### Fibrin Sheath

Within hours to days of catheter placement, fibrin and other blood proteins begin to deposit on the external catheter surface. This **fibrin sheath** progressively encases the catheter like a sleeve:

- **Early:** Loose fibrin tail at the catheter tip; may cause withdrawal occlusion (flush normal, blood return absent)
- **Established:** Complete fibrin sleeve along catheter length; infusate may reflux along the external catheter surface rather than exiting at the tip
- **Clinical significance:** Fibrin sheaths are present radiographically in nearly all CVADs after several weeks of dwell; most are clinically silent. Fibrin sheaths are a nidus for bacterial colonization and can contribute to catheter infection.

### Mural Thrombus

Organized thrombus attached to the vessel wall at or near the catheter tip or insertion site, without complete venous occlusion. May be an incidental finding on ultrasound; if identified, warrants close monitoring and may require anticoagulation depending on size and clinical context.

### Intraluminal Thrombus

Thrombus within the catheter lumen, causing catheter occlusion. Managed with thrombolytic therapy (alteplase). Distinct from UEDVT (which is a venous thrombosis, not catheter lumen thrombus).

### Upper Extremity DVT (UEDVT)

Complete or partial thrombosis of one or more named upper extremity veins associated with catheter presence. Symptomatic UEDVT is the clinically significant catheter-associated thrombosis requiring intervention.

## PICC-Associated UEDVT: Epidemiology

PICC lines carry significantly higher UEDVT risk than other CVAD types, related to their long peripheral intravascular course through relatively small upper extremity veins.

**Published incidence rates:**
- Symptomatic UEDVT: 1–6% of PICC placements
- Subclinical DVT (ultrasound-detected): 10–38% (varies by surveillance method and patient population)
- In oncology patients: rates increase to 3–10% symptomatic, up to 50% subclinical

Chopra et al. (2013, *Lancet*) meta-analysis of 64 studies: PICC placement was associated with 2.55-fold higher DVT risk compared to non-tunneled CVCs, driven primarily by the subclavian/axillary vein course.

**Other CVAD types:**
- Non-tunneled CVC (IJ/subclavian): lower UEDVT rate than PICC
- Femoral CVC: highest lower extremity DVT rate (IVC/iliac thrombosis)
- Tunneled CVC and port: lower thrombosis rate per dwell-day than PICC or non-tunneled CVC

## Risk Factors

**Catheter-related:**
- **Catheter-to-vein ratio >45%:** Strongest modifiable risk factor; larger catheter relative to vein diameter causes endothelial injury and turbulent flow
- Multi-lumen > single-lumen catheters (larger Fr size)
- Left-sided PICC insertion (longer brachiocephalic vein course)
- Malpositioned tip (proximal tip reduces hemodilution, increases endothelial exposure)

**Patient-related:**
- Active malignancy (hypercoagulable state from cancer procoagulants, chemotherapy)
- Prior DVT or PE
- Hereditary thrombophilia (Factor V Leiden, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, protein C/S deficiency)
- ICU admission and immobility
- CKD (thrombotic tendency)
- Obesity

## Diagnosis

### Clinical Presentation

Symptomatic UEDVT typically presents with:
- **Arm swelling** (the most sensitive sign) — may be unilateral, more pronounced than contralateral
- **Arm pain or aching** along the catheter course
- **Erythema and warmth** over the thrombosed vein
- **Palpable cord** in antecubital fossa or along medial upper arm
- **Collateral venous distension** over the shoulder or chest (if subclavian/brachiocephalic involvement)

**Note:** Many DVTs associated with catheters are minimally or non-symptomatic. The absence of symptoms does not exclude DVT.

### Diagnostic Workup

**Upper extremity duplex ultrasound (UEDUS):** Gold standard diagnostic test. Non-invasive, widely available, sensitivity/specificity >90–95% for DVT in the upper extremity veins visualized by ultrasound (axillary, basilic, brachial, subclavian).

**Limitations of UEDUS:** The SVC, brachiocephalic vein, and central subclavian vein are not directly visualizable by duplex ultrasound. If there is strong clinical suspicion for central venous thrombosis not seen on ultrasound, CT venography or MR venography of the chest is required.

**CT venography with contrast:** Most comprehensive evaluation; recommended when SVC or innominate vein thrombosis is suspected (SVC syndrome).

**D-dimer:** Sensitive but non-specific for DVT; elevated in many hospitalized patients. Not useful for DVT diagnosis in hospitalized CVAD patients.

## Treatment: Anticoagulation Decision Framework

### To Remove or Not to Remove the Catheter

This is the central treatment decision.

**Remove PICC/CVC if:**
- The catheter is no longer clinically indicated (most common scenario — DVT identified when catheter is no longer needed)
- The patient has a symptomatic DVT and is at high bleeding risk where anticoagulation is problematic
- The catheter is the suspected source of ongoing bacteremia
- Multiple failed anticoagulation courses with catheter in place

**Retain catheter if:**
- The catheter is still essential for ongoing therapy (OPAT, cancer treatment, TPN)
- The UEDVT is an incidental/asymptomatic finding with clearly necessary catheter
- Catheter removal would leave the patient without adequate IV access

**Note:** Catheter removal alone (without anticoagulation) may not be sufficient treatment for established symptomatic UEDVT — discuss with hematology or vascular medicine.

### Anticoagulation Recommendations

Per CHEST/ACCP Guidelines 2016 (Kearon et al.) for CVAD-associated UEDVT:

**Anticoagulate symptomatic UEDVT** (Grade 1B recommendation):
- Anticoagulate for **at least 3 months**, or for the duration of catheter presence plus at least 3 months if catheter is retained — whichever is longer
- Anticoagulate for full treatment duration even if catheter is removed (do not stop anticoagulation at catheter removal)

**Anticoagulation options:**
- **LMWH (enoxaparin):** Preferred initial agent, especially in cancer patients (LMWH superior to warfarin in cancer-associated DVT)
- **Apixaban or rivaroxaban (DOACs):** Emerging evidence supports DOACs for UEDVT; increasingly used
- **Warfarin:** Acceptable alternative; requires INR monitoring; less convenient than DOAC

**Asymptomatic UEDVT:**
- Consider anticoagulation on case-by-case basis
- Factors favoring anticoagulation: large thrombus burden, proximal extension, cancer patient, known thrombophilia
- Factors against: high bleeding risk, minor incidental thrombus, short remaining catheter dwell

### SVC Syndrome

Rare but serious: bilateral arm swelling, facial edema, distended neck veins, headache — from superior vena cava thrombosis or extrinsic compression. Requires urgent evaluation, CT venography, and vascular/IR consultation for possible SVC thrombectomy or stenting.

## Prevention

**Primary prevention (for all CVAD patients):**
- Optimize catheter-to-vein ratio: select smallest Fr size that meets clinical need; confirm vein diameter ≥3 mm before PICC insertion; target ratio ≤45%
- Correct tip position at CAJ
- Use single-lumen catheter when one lumen suffices
- Daily necessity review — remove catheter when no longer needed

**No routine pharmacologic prophylaxis** is recommended for PICC/CVAD patients absent other DVT risk factors. Multiple RCTs of prophylactic LMWH or warfarin specifically for PICC-DVT prevention have not shown benefit sufficient to justify routine use.
