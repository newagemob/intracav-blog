# Infiltration and Extravasation: Clinical Guide to Recognition, Staging, and Treatment

Infiltration and extravasation represent the unintended delivery of infusate into surrounding tissue rather than the intended intravascular space. While infiltration (non-vesicant fluids) is painful and potentially serious, extravasation (vesicant agents) can cause severe tissue destruction, necrosis, and permanent functional impairment. Rapid recognition, staging, and agent-specific management are essential to minimize tissue injury.

## Definitions

**Infiltration:** The inadvertent administration of a non-vesicant fluid or medication into the surrounding tissue. The catheter tip has exited the vein lumen, or the vein has ruptured. Examples: normal saline, dextrose, standard antibiotics (non-vesicant).

**Extravasation:** The inadvertent administration of a vesicant medication or solution into the surrounding tissue. Vesicants can cause blistering, tissue necrosis, and permanent injury. Examples: anthracycline chemotherapy, vinca alkaloids, concentrated potassium, vasopressors at high concentrations.

**Key distinction:** The clinical response and urgency differ dramatically based on whether the infusate is a vesicant. Every medication infused via vascular access should be classified as vesicant or non-vesicant before infusion begins.

## INS Infiltration Staging Scale

The INS staging scale (2021) provides a standardized framework for documenting the severity of infiltration.

| Grade | Description | Signs | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0** | No symptoms | — | Monitor |
| **1** | Blanched skin, cool to touch, edema <1 inch diameter, no pain | Pale, cool skin at site | Discontinue IV; elevate; consider warm compress |
| **2** | Blanched skin, edema 1–6 inches, cool to touch, with or without pain | Moderate swelling | Discontinue IV; elevate; warm compress; reassess in 1 hour |
| **3** | Blanched skin, translucent skin, edema >6 inches; gross edema with or without pitting; skin cool; mild-moderate pain; possible numbness | Significant swelling; blistering possible | Discontinue IV; elevate; notify provider; document |
| **4** | Skin tight, leaking; skin discolored, bruised, swollen; indented; gross edema; deep pitting tissue edema; circulatory impairment; moderate to severe pain; infiltration of any amount of blood product, irritant, or vesicant | Severe injury; potential necrosis | **Emergency response** (see below); provider notification immediately; antidote if vesicant |

**Note for vesicant extravasation:** Even a small infiltration of a vesicant may produce grade 4 injury over hours to days. Grade the infiltration at the time of recognition AND recognize that vesicant injury may worsen significantly after the infusion is stopped.

---

## Recognition

### Signs of Infiltration/Extravasation

**Subjective:**
- Pain, burning, or stinging at the infusion site
- Pressure sensation
- Tightness or "fullness" in the arm
- Change in infusion feel

**Objective:**
- Swelling at or around the insertion site
- Blanching (pallor) or skin color change
- Firmness or induration of tissue
- Coolness of skin (non-vesicant: cool from fluid; vasopressor: cool from ischemia)
- Blistering or skin necrosis (late sign — indicates significant injury)
- Resistance to flushing or slowed infusion rate
- Absent blood return (may indicate catheter displacement)

### Assessment Frequency for Vesicant Infusions

Per INS 2021 Standard 27 (Vesicant Therapy):
- Assess infusion site and distal circulation **at least every 1–2 hours** during vesicant infusion via peripheral IV
- Confirm **blood return before vesicant administration** and periodically during infusion
- For peripheral vesicant infusion (when unavoidably necessary): have antidote immediately available; do not leave patient unattended during infusion

### Post-Infusion Assessment

Document site assessment after completion of any vesicant infusion:
- Site appearance (erythema, swelling, blistering)
- Patient subjective report
- Distal extremity circulation check

## Emergency Response to Vesicant Extravasation

### Immediate Actions (Within Minutes)

1. **STOP the infusion immediately** — disconnect infusion but do not remove the catheter yet
2. **Do not apply pressure** to the extravasation site — pressure disperses drug into a wider tissue area
3. **Attempt to aspirate:** Using the intact catheter, gently aspirate to remove as much vesicant as possible from the tissue. Withdraw slowly with maximum negative pressure (up to 5 mL); discard aspirate
4. **Remove catheter** after aspiration attempt is complete (do not remove before attempting aspiration)
5. **Mark the extravasation area** with a skin marker — outline the area of swelling/discoloration; this documents the extent at the time of recognition and allows comparison to subsequent examinations
6. **Notify provider immediately** — vesicant extravasation is a medical emergency
7. **Photograph the site** (per institutional policy)
8. **Apply antidote if indicated** (see table below)
9. **Position:** Elevate extremity above heart level (for most extravasations; exception: norepinephrine/vasopressor — see below)
10. **Document** full circumstances, extent, and actions in patient record

### Warm vs. Cold Application

**Cold compress (ice):**
- **Anthracyclines, taxanes, cisplatin, and most non-vesicant extravasations**
- Cold reduces local blood flow, limiting drug spread
- Apply 15–20 minutes, 4 times daily × 24–48 hours
- Do not apply ice directly to skin; use ice pack with cloth barrier

**Warm compress (dry heat):**
- **Vinca alkaloids, etoposide, vinorelbine**
- Heat increases local blood flow and vascular absorption of the drug
- Apply 15–20 minutes, 4 times daily × 24–48 hours

**Vasopressors (norepinephrine, dopamine):**
- Warm if needed; apply phentolamine antidote

## Antidote Reference Table

| Vesicant Category | Antidote | Dose and Route | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Anthracyclines** (doxorubicin, epirubicin) | **Dexrazoxane (Totect/Savene)** | 1,000 mg/m² IV (Day 1, 2); 500 mg/m² IV (Day 3) | ONLY FDA-approved antidote for anthracycline extravasation; must give within 6 hours; requires IV administration; do not apply cooling within 15 min of dexrazoxane injection |
| **Vinca alkaloids** (vincristine, vinblastine) | **Hyaluronidase** | 1–6 mL of 150 units/mL; inject SQ around extravasation site | Inject within 1 hour; multiple SQ injections in a clockwise pattern around the periphery of the extravasation area |
| **Taxanes** (paclitaxel, docetaxel) | Hyaluronidase | Same as vinca alkaloids | Apply cold compress after antidote |
| **Vasopressors** (norepinephrine, dopamine, phenylephrine) | **Phentolamine** | 5–10 mg diluted in 10 mL NS; inject SQ in extravasation area within 12 hours | Alpha-adrenergic blocker reverses vasopressor-induced ischemia; inject within 12 hours for effect; monitor for hypotension |
| **Concentrated KCl, calcium** | Hyaluronidase | As above | Supportive; wound care |

**Note:** Antidote availability and protocols vary by institution. Ensure antidotes are stocked and accessible before initiating vesicant infusions. Pharmacy consultation required for all significant extravasation events.

## Follow-Up and Wound Care

### Monitoring After Extravasation

- Photograph and document site every 8 hours for 24–48 hours
- Document pain level, swelling extent (in cm), skin changes
- Plastic surgery or wound care consultation for grade 3–4 extravasation
- Consider surgical debridement if blistering, skin necrosis, or tissue breakdown develops
- Functional assessment (range of motion, sensation) for extravasations near joints or nerve structures

### Documentation

Required at the time of recognition and in follow-up:
- Date and time of recognition
- Vesicant name and estimated volume extravasated
- Stage of infiltration at recognition
- Catheter removal time, aspiration attempt and result
- Antidote administered: name, dose, route, time
- Cold/warm application: type, duration, frequency
- Photographs taken (per policy)
- Provider notification: name, time, response
- Patient education provided
- Follow-up assessment plan

## Prevention

**Primary prevention: Use central access for all vesicant infusions.** All chemotherapy vesicants and concentrated vasoactive infusions should be administered via a central catheter (PICC, CVC, or port) to minimize extravasation risk. See [Evidence-Based Device Selection](/guides/vascular-access/evidence-based-device-selection/) for osmolarity and pH thresholds.

**When peripheral vesicant administration is unavoidable:**
- Use the largest accessible vein in the forearm; avoid hand, wrist, and antecubital fossa
- Confirm blood return before and periodically during infusion
- Have antidote immediately available at the bedside
- Assess site every 30–60 minutes during infusion
- Never leave patient unattended during peripheral vesicant infusion
