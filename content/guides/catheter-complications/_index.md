# Catheter Complications: Recognition, Prevention, and Management

Vascular access devices are life-enabling interventions — but they carry inherent complication risk that every clinician managing IV access must be prepared to recognize and manage. Complications span infectious, thrombotic, mechanical, and dermatologic categories. The complication burden is substantial: across millions of catheter-days annually in US healthcare, even low per-device complication rates translate to tens of thousands of preventable adverse events each year.

This pillar guide provides a comprehensive reference for the full spectrum of catheter complications, with emphasis on early recognition and evidence-based response. Each section links to focused satellite guides for deeper clinical detail.

## Overview: The Complication Burden

| Complication Type | Approximate Incidence | Preventable? |
|---|---|---|
| CLABSI (central line BSI) | 0.5–2.0 per 1,000 catheter-days | 70–90% yes |
| PICC-associated DVT (symptomatic) | 1–5% per PICC dwell | Partially |
| Catheter occlusion | 10–35% of CVADs during dwell | Largely yes |
| Phlebitis (PIV) | 20–50% of peripheral IVs | Largely yes |
| PIV infiltration | 20–70% of peripheral IVs | Largely yes |
| Vesicant extravasation | 0.5–6% of IV chemotherapy | Largely yes |
| Air embolism | Rare; incidence underreported | Largely yes |
| CVAD malposition | 2–10% at insertion | Yes (ECG guidance) |
| MARSI | ~1.5 million events/year in US | Largely yes |

The most actionable insight: the vast majority of catheter complications are preventable with standardized assessment, appropriate device selection, proper insertion technique, and disciplined maintenance practice.

## Infectious Complications

### CLABSI (Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection)

CLABSI is covered comprehensively in the [CLABSI Prevention guide](/guides/clabsi-prevention/). Key clinical points:

**Recognition:** New fever, chills, or hemodynamic instability in a patient with a central line — in the absence of another identified infection source — should trigger consideration of catheter-related bloodstream infection. Blood cultures (minimum 2 sets, at least 1 percutaneous) should be obtained before initiating antibiotics.

**Action on suspected CLABSI:**
1. Draw blood cultures (2 sets, including one percutaneous; one from each lumen of multilumen catheter if possible)
2. Notify provider immediately
3. Evaluate whether catheter should be removed or retained based on clinical status, suspected organism, and infection type
4. Consult infectious disease as appropriate
5. Begin empiric antibiotics per institutional protocol (typically covering MRSA and gram-negatives)

**Catheter removal decision:** Catheter removal is generally required for fungemia, complicated infections (tunnel infection, endocarditis), or persistence of fever/bacteremia after 72 hours of appropriate antibiotics. Catheter salvage may be attempted for uncomplicated coagulase-negative staphylococcal CLABSI per IDSA guidance.

## Catheter-Associated Thrombosis

### Upper Extremity DVT (UEDVT) in PICC and CVAD Patients

PICC-associated upper extremity DVT (UEDVT) is a clinically significant and underrecognized complication. Symptomatic incidence is 1–5% per PICC dwell; asymptomatic UEDVT may affect 30–60% of PICC patients in high-risk populations (active malignancy, multilumen PICC) when systematic ultrasound surveillance is performed.

**Risk factors:** Active cancer, multiple lumens, prior DVT in same arm, large catheter-to-vein diameter ratio (>45%), immobility, and use of inferior vein (cephalic vs basilic).

**Recognition:** Unilateral arm swelling, warmth, erythema, or heaviness in the arm with a PICC or CVC. Diagnosis confirmed by upper extremity duplex venous ultrasound.

**Management:**
- LMWH, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), or UFH depending on clinical context (cancer patients: LMWH or rivaroxaban preferred per ASCO/ASH guidelines)
- Catheter removal: not always immediately required if catheter is functional and still needed; shared decision-making with patient and hematology/oncology
- Duration of anticoagulation: minimum 3 months; ongoing if catheter remains in place

### Intraluminal Thrombosis and Fibrin Sheath

Fibrin sheath formation around the catheter tip and intraluminal thrombus are the primary causes of catheter occlusion (see section below). Fibrin sheath can also harbor organisms, contributing to CLABSI risk. Prevention: consistent flushing per SASH protocol.

---

## Catheter Occlusion

Catheter occlusion — defined as inability to infuse, aspirate, or both — is the most common non-infectious complication of long-term vascular access devices.

**Types of occlusion:**

| Type | Mechanism | Management |
|---|---|---|
| Thrombotic (complete) | Intraluminal clot | tPA (alteplase) instillation |
| Thrombotic (partial / withdrawal) | Fibrin sheath at catheter tip | tPA; positional assessment |
| Non-thrombotic: precipitate | Drug-drug or drug-solution incompatibility (e.g., Ca-PO4 in PN) | HCl or NaHCO3 depending on precipitate |
| Non-thrombotic: lipid deposit | Long-term lipid infusion | 70% ethanol lock (per protocol) |
| Mechanical | Kinked catheter, pinch-off syndrome, external compression | Repositioning; imaging |

**Alteplase (tPA) protocol for thrombotic occlusion:**
- Dose: 2 mg in 2 mL instilled per occluded lumen
- Dwell time: 30–120 minutes (reassess at 30 min; re-instill for 120 min dwell if needed)
- Efficacy: 85–90% restoration of patency in prospective trials
- Contraindications: active hemorrhage, recent surgery (<3 days), intracranial pathology

**Never use high-pressure force-flushing to clear an occluded catheter** — this can cause catheter rupture or embolization of a thrombus. Use only a 10 mL syringe (smaller syringes generate excessive pressure).

See [Catheter Occlusion: Causes and Thrombolytic Protocols](/guides/catheter-complications/catheter-occlusion-management/) for the complete management guide.

## Phlebitis

Phlebitis — inflammation of the vein wall — is the most common complication of peripheral IV therapy. It is classified by etiology and graded by severity.

**Types:**
- **Chemical phlebitis**: caused by infusate pH, osmolarity, or chemical irritation (medications, solutions)
- **Mechanical phlebitis**: caused by catheter movement, catheter-to-vein size mismatch, or catheter material
- **Bacterial phlebitis**: infectious contamination of the catheter or infusate
- **Post-infusion phlebitis**: develops 24–96 hours after catheter removal; often underdiagnosed

**Grading (Visual Infusion Phlebitis Scale / INS Phlebitis Scale):**

| Grade | Signs | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | No signs | Continue monitoring |
| 1 | Erythema at site, with or without pain | Observe; consider site change |
| 2 | Pain at site; erythema, edema, and/or palpable venous cord | Remove and resite catheter |
| 3 | Pain, erythema, edema; palpable cord >2.5 cm above site | Remove immediately; consider treatment |
| 4 | Pain, purulent drainage, palpable cord; possible tissue ischemia | Remove immediately; obtain culture; notify provider |

**Management:** Grade ≤1 may be observed with increased monitoring. Grade ≥2: remove catheter, apply warm compress, elevate extremity, document. Grade 4: treat as infected; notify provider; obtain wound/blood cultures; consider antibiotics.

See [Phlebitis: Recognition, Grading, and Management](/guides/catheter-complications/phlebitis-recognition-management/) for the complete guide.

## Infiltration and Extravasation

Infiltration and extravasation represent the unintended delivery of infusate into the tissue surrounding a catheter, rather than into the vascular lumen.

**Key distinction:**
- **Infiltration**: non-vesicant fluid leaks into surrounding tissue — typically manageable conservatively
- **Extravasation**: vesicant or irritant fluid leaks into tissue — carries risk of tissue necrosis, blistering, and long-term injury

**INS Infiltration/Extravasation Staging (0–4):**

| Stage | Clinical Findings |
|---|---|
| 0 | No symptoms |
| 1 | Skin blanched, edematous, cool to touch; IV infusing slowly; patient reports pain |
| 2 | Skin blanched, edematous, cool to touch; IV not infusing; patient reports pain |
| 3 | Edema >1 inch in any direction; IV not infusing; pain; skin blanched, translucent |
| 4 | Skin taut, translucent; discoloration, blistering, bruising, severe pain; tissue necrosis possible; circulation impaired |

**Vesicant extravasation — immediate response:**
1. **Stop infusion immediately** — do not remove catheter yet
2. Aspirate as much residual drug as possible through the catheter before removal
3. Remove catheter after aspiration attempt
4. Mark boundaries of affected area with pen
5. Apply antidote if applicable (see below); apply warm or cold compress per agent type
6. Notify provider and document in EHR
7. Photograph site at presentation and follow-up

**Antidote reference by vesicant class:**

| Agent | Antidote | Application |
|---|---|---|
| Anthracyclines (doxorubicin) | Dexrazoxane (Totect/Savene) | IV infusion within 6 hours |
| Vinca alkaloids (vincristine) | Hyaluronidase | SC injection around site + warm compress |
| Taxanes (paclitaxel) | Hyaluronidase | SC injection around site |
| Vasopressors (norepinephrine) | Phentolamine | SC injection around site |
| DNA-alkylating agents | Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) | Topical application |
| Most non-vesicant solutions | None specific | Warm compress, elevation |

See [Infiltration and Extravasation: Staging and Emergency Management](/guides/catheter-complications/infiltration-extravasation-guide/) for the complete guide.

## Air Embolism

Venous air embolism (VAE) during vascular access procedures is a rare but life-threatening complication caused by air entering the vascular system. Air can enter during catheter insertion, during infusion system changes, or — most commonly and preventably — during **CVAD removal**.

**Pathophysiology:** Air entering the venous system travels to the right heart and pulmonary vasculature. Small volumes (<1 mL) are generally tolerated. Larger volumes (>5–10 mL) can cause "air lock" in the right ventricle, cardiovascular collapse, and death.

**At-risk scenarios:**
- CVC or PICC removal (most common): negative intrathoracic pressure on inspiration draws air through the catheter tract
- IV tubing disconnection or end of infusion with open tubing
- Port deaccessing if not done with positive pressure
- CVC insertion (needle removal before guidewire placed)

**Emergency response:**
1. Position patient in **left lateral decubitus + Trendelenburg** (Durant's maneuver) — traps air in right atrium apex, away from right ventricular outflow
2. Administer **100% oxygen** immediately (displaces nitrogen from air embolism, accelerates reabsorption)
3. Attempt aspiration of air via central line if in place
4. Call for emergency support; monitor hemodynamics
5. **Hyperbaric oxygen** for severe neurological or hemodynamic compromise (if available and feasible)

**Prevention during CVAD removal:**
- Position patient **supine or in Trendelenburg** before removal
- Instruct patient to **Valsalva or hold breath** (positive intrathoracic pressure) during withdrawal
- Remove catheter with **smooth, continuous motion**
- Apply **occlusive dressing immediately** — maintain for ≥30 minutes

See [Air Embolism: Prevention and Emergency Response](/guides/catheter-complications/air-embolism-prevention-guide/) for the complete guide.

## Catheter Malposition

CVAD malposition — incorrect tip location — occurs in approximately 2–10% of catheter insertions. It may be primary (at insertion) or secondary (catheter migration during dwell).

**Common malposition sites:**
- Internal jugular vein (from subclavian or PICC approach)
- Contralateral subclavian vein
- Axillary vein (PICC tip too short)
- Right atrium or right ventricle (tip advanced too far)
- Azygous vein

**Consequences:** Malpositioned tips cause arrhythmias, vessel wall erosion, inadequate medication dilution, and inaccurate hemodynamic monitoring. An IJ malposition means central access medications may be infusing peripherally with inadequate dilution.

**Prevention:** Intraprocedural ECG guidance (Sherlock 3CG, MIRUS, Nautilus systems) provides real-time tip position feedback and reduces malposition rates by 50–70% compared to landmark technique with post-procedure CXR confirmation alone.

See [CVAD Malposition: Recognition and Repositioning](/guides/catheter-complications/catheter-malposition-guide/) for the complete guide.

## Medical Adhesive-Related Skin Injury (MARSI)

MARSI encompasses a spectrum of skin injuries related to catheter securement devices and dressings:

- **Skin tear**: separation of the epidermis during dressing removal
- **Tension blisters**: from excess tension on the skin by the adhesive
- **Contact dermatitis**: allergic or irritant reaction to adhesive materials (CHG, acrylic adhesives)
- **Folliculitis**: inflammation of hair follicles beneath the dressing
- **Medical adhesive residue**: adhesive remaining on skin after removal

**MARSI Prevention:**
- Use the minimum adhesive area necessary for secure fixation
- Apply skin barrier product (liquid film barrier) beneath adhesive edges for at-risk skin
- Remove dressings at a 180° angle (pushing skin away, not pulling dressing away)
- Gently lift dressing edges with medical adhesive remover wipe before removal
- Never remove dressings rapidly — slow, deliberate technique prevents skin tears
- Assess skin integrity at every dressing change; document and stage any MARSI identified

---

## Nerve Injury

Nerve injury during vascular access procedures is uncommon but can cause lasting harm, particularly during upper extremity catheterization.

**Mechanism:** Direct nerve puncture or hematoma compression of adjacent nerves. Most commonly affects the **median nerve** (brachial approach for PICC), **radial nerve**, or components of the **brachial plexus**.

**Recognition:** New paresthesia, weakness, or persistent pain in the arm following catheter insertion. Any neurological symptom following a PICC insertion requires immediate catheter removal and neurology consultation.

**Prevention:** Strict ultrasound guidance during PICC insertion with visualization of the brachial plexus; immediate withdrawal and repositioning if patient reports sharp, shooting, or electric pain during needle insertion.
