# Implanted Vascular Access Ports: Complete Clinical Guide

The implanted vascular access port — commonly called a "port," "port-a-cath," or "mediport" — is the gold standard for long-term, intermittent central venous access. With no external components between accesses and the lowest CLABSI rate of all CVADs per comparable dwell period, the port enables patients to maintain normal daily activities including swimming, showering, and physical activity.

This guide covers port anatomy, access and deaccess technique, maintenance protocols, power-injectable port capabilities, and complication management.

## Port Anatomy and Device Types

### Basic Anatomy

An implanted port consists of two components:

**Reservoir (port body):** A subcutaneously implanted housing containing a rigid outer shell (titanium, stainless steel, or plastic) and a silicone **septum** — the access point through which the Huber needle is inserted. The septum is designed to reseal after needle removal and can withstand thousands of punctures over the device's lifespan (typically 10+ years, >2,000 punctures).

**Catheter:** Connected to the port body's outlet and advanced to the SVC/CAJ. The port body sits in a subcutaneous pocket over the chest wall; the catheter is tunneled subcutaneously to the venous access point (IJ or subclavian vein).

### Device Variations

**Single-lumen port:** Most common; sufficient for most oncology and IV therapy indications.

**Double-lumen port:** Two reservoirs with separate catheters or a dual-lumen catheter; used for patients requiring simultaneous infusions of incompatible agents (e.g., TPN + chemotherapy).

**Power-injectable ports:** Designed to withstand the high-pressure injection used in CT contrast administration (power injection rates up to 5 mL/sec). Identified by a distinctive triangular or ribbed reservoir profile; marked with "CT" or "power" designation. Not all ports are power injectable — confirm before CT contrast injection. Power-injectable ports are now preferred for most cancer patients who require routine CT imaging.

**Arm ports (Vortex/PAS port):** Small ports implanted in the upper arm (typically via basilic vein). Lower profile, patient comfort, cosmetic considerations. Same access principles apply; Huber needle technique is identical.

## When to Use an Implanted Port

### Appropriate Indications

- **Intermittent chemotherapy:** Port is the preferred access device for chemotherapy cycles (e.g., weekly or every-3-week infusions) — no external device between treatments
- **Long-term intermittent IV therapy:** Monthly infusions (immune therapies, enzyme replacement, biologic agents)
- **Home TPN for >3–6 months:** Port preferred over long-term PICC for quality of life
- **Frequent blood sampling:** Port access consolidates blood draw needs in appropriate patients
- **Patient preference:** Patients who prioritize body image, daily activity freedom, and no external device

### Port vs. PICC vs. Tunneled CVC

| Feature | Implanted Port | PICC | Tunneled CVC |
|---|---|---|---|
| External component | None between accesses | Yes (always visible) | Yes (always visible) |
| Daily access | Needle access required | Direct hub access | Direct hub access |
| CLABSI risk per dwell-day | Lowest | Low-moderate | Low |
| Best for | Intermittent therapy | Daily/continuous therapy | Daily/continuous therapy |
| Swimming | Permitted (no needle) | Contraindicated | Contraindicated |
| Placement | Surgical/IR | Bedside RN/IR | IR/surgery |
| Removal | Surgical/IR | Bedside nursing | IR/surgery |

**Choose port when:** Therapy is intermittent (not daily), patient will have the device for months to years, patient quality of life between infusions is a priority.

**Choose PICC or tunneled CVC when:** Therapy requires daily IV access (home TPN, daily antibiotics), daily needle access through the port septum would be burdensome.

## Accessing the Port: Huber Needle Technique

### Why Only Huber Needles

Standard hypodermic needles **must never be used** to access a port. A conventional beveled needle cores the silicone septum, permanently damaging it and allowing the cored silicone fragment to enter the bloodstream or reducing the septum's ability to re-seal. The **Huber (non-coring) needle** has a deflected tip that pushes septum material aside rather than cutting it, allowing the septum to reseal after needle removal.

Available in: 19G, 20G, 22G; various lengths (3/4", 1", 1.5") — select based on subcutaneous tissue depth overlying the port reservoir.

### Equipment

- Sterile gloves
- Appropriate Huber needle with attached extension set
- CHG antiseptic swabs or CHG/IPA pad
- 10 mL syringes (3–4)
- Normal saline (10 mL per syringe)
- Heparin 100 units/mL (5 mL syringe) for locking
- Dressing supplies (TSM, CHG gel patch if not integrated into Huber set)
- Sterile field

### Access Procedure (ANTT Principles)

1. **Identify port location:** Visually and by palpation. Locate the edges of the reservoir; identify the center of the septum as the target.
2. **Hand hygiene and sterile gloves.**
3. **Skin antisepsis:** Apply CHG/IPA to skin overlying port; allow complete dry time (30–60 seconds). Assess skin integrity; do not access through a wound or infection.
4. **Prime Huber needle:** Flush extension set with 10 mL normal saline; leave saline-filled.
5. **Stabilize the port:** Use non-dominant hand to stabilize the port body between thumb and two fingers, preventing it from shifting during needle insertion.
6. **Insert Huber needle:** Insert perpendicular to the skin, through the center of the septum, until the needle tip contacts the metal backplate of the reservoir (feel the "stop" of the needle against the back of the reservoir). Do not insert at an angle — angled insertion may miss the septum or damage the reservoir.
7. **Confirm placement:** Aspirate to confirm blood return (dark venous blood). If no blood return, gently flush 2–3 mL saline and reassess — blood return may require arm repositioning or Valsalva in some patients.
8. **Flush:** Flush with 10 mL normal saline pulsatile; confirm no resistance or swelling.
9. **Apply dressing:** TSM dressing over the needle and exit site (with CHG gel patch if not integrated). Stabilize needle hub to prevent dislodgement.
10. **Label:** Date and time of access; Huber needle gauge and length; clinician initials.

### Troubleshooting: No Blood Return

- Reposition patient arm or have patient raise arms above head (Valsalva)
- Gently flush 5–10 mL NS and reassess
- Reposition Huber needle (may be against back wall — withdraw 1–2 mm)
- If persistent, obtain imaging — port may have tip malposition, fibrin sheath, or catheter occlusion

Do not use port for any infusion without confirmed blood return on initial access verification.

## Dressing and Maintenance While Accessed

When a port is accessed for a continuous infusion (e.g., during chemotherapy, during hospital admission):

- Change dressing every 5–7 days (TSM), or sooner if wet/soiled/non-intact — same as other CVADs
- Apply CHG gel patch at the Huber needle insertion point under the TSM
- Scrub-the-hub before every access
- SASH flushing protocol between infusions
- Assess port site at each dressing change for erythema, swelling, tenderness, needle stability

---

## Deaccessing the Port

1. Prime a 10 mL syringe with normal saline
2. If port was in use, flush and lock (see below) before deaccess
3. Stabilize port body with non-dominant hand
4. Withdraw Huber needle with steady, perpendicular motion
5. Apply gauze and pressure for 1–2 minutes (longer if anticoagulated)
6. Apply small bandage to puncture site

---

## Flushing and Locking Protocol

### When Accessed (In Use)

SASH protocol:
- 10 mL NS pulsatile before each infusion
- 10 mL NS pulsatile after each infusion
- 5 mL heparin 100 units/mL lock (or per institutional policy — some use 500 units/mL for ports)

### When Deaccessing / Monthly Maintenance Flush

When a port is not actively in use, it requires a maintenance flush to maintain patency. Standard 42:
- Minimum every **4–6 weeks** between uses: flush with 10 mL NS pulsatile, then heparin 100 units/mL (5 mL) positive pressure lock

Many ports tolerate longer intervals without flushing (particularly Groshong-valved ports), but monthly flushing is the standard of care. Patients should have a scheduled monthly flush visit documented in their care plan.

## Complications

### Port Pocket Infection

Infection in the subcutaneous pocket containing the port reservoir. Signs: erythema, tenderness, warmth, fluctuance, or discharge at the port pocket site.

**Significance:** Port pocket infections typically require port removal — the port body is a foreign object that cannot be sterilized with antibiotics alone.

### Port-Associated CLABSI

Lower rate per dwell-day than other CVADs, but accumulated risk is significant over years of dwell. Prevention: strict ANTT for all port access procedures; monthly flushing; minimize access frequency.

### Port Thrombosis / Occlusion

Managed with alteplase (same as PICC protocol: 2 mg/2 mL instilled into port via Huber needle). Confirm Huber needle placement before alteplase instillation.

### Extravasation Through Port

Port extravasation occurs when the Huber needle is not fully seated in the reservoir (partial dislodgement) or when a fibrin sheath has occluded the catheter tip and diverted infusate into the subcutaneous tissue. Vesicant extravasation through a port is a serious injury — the large volume of subcutaneous space and delayed recognition can result in significant tissue necrosis.

**Prevention:** Confirm blood return before every infusion; use dedicated port sets with safety features that alert to pressure changes.

### Pinch-Off Syndrome

Compression of the catheter between the clavicle and first rib (at the costoclavicular junction in subclavian-entry ports) causes catheter compression — presenting as positional catheter function (works in one position, not another) and eventually catheter fracture. Requires catheter replacement.
