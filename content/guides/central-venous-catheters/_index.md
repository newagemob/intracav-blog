# Central Venous Catheters: Types, Indications, and Clinical Safety

Central vascular access devices (CVADs) form the backbone of advanced IV therapy across hospital and home settings. The term "central venous catheter (CVC)" encompasses a diverse family of devices — from short-term non-tunneled lines placed in the ICU to surgically implanted ports used for years of chemotherapy — each with distinct indications, insertion approaches, maintenance requirements, and complication profiles.

This guide covers the full CVAD family: device classification, non-tunneled CVC site selection, tunneled catheters, implanted ports, dialysis access, and the critical standards governing tip position.

## CVC Overview and Classification

CVADs are categorized by several attributes:

| Dimension | Options |
|---|---|
| Tunneling | Non-tunneled (short-term) vs. tunneled (long-term) |
| Access | Externalized (external hub) vs. implanted (internal reservoir) |
| Entry route | Peripheral (PICC) vs. direct central (IJ, subclavian, femoral) |
| Intended dwell | Days to weeks (non-tunneled) vs. months to years (tunneled, port) |
| Lumen count | Single, double, triple, or quad-lumen |

**CVAD classification framework:**

| Device | Entry | Tunneled? | Dwell | External? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Non-tunneled CVC | IJ, subclavian, femoral | No | Days–2 weeks | Yes |
| PICC | Upper arm peripheral vein | No | Weeks–months | Yes |
| Tunneled CVC (Hickman, Broviac, Groshong) | Central vein; SC tunnel | Yes | Months–years | Yes |
| Implanted port | Central vein; SC pocket | Yes (surgically) | Years | No (subcutaneous) |
| Tunneled hemodialysis catheter | IJ or femoral | Yes | Months | Yes |
| Non-tunneled dialysis catheter | IJ or femoral | No | Days–weeks | Yes |

## Non-Tunneled CVCs: Site Selection Evidence

Non-tunneled CVCs are the workhorse of ICU and acute care central access. They are placed at the bedside (or with ultrasound guidance) and are designed for short-term use — days to approximately 2 weeks.

### Internal Jugular (IJ) Approach

The IJ vein runs lateral to the carotid artery beneath the sternocleidomastoid muscle and is the **preferred approach for real-time ultrasound-guided** CVC insertion in adults.

**Advantages:** Easily visualized with ultrasound, compressible site (bleeding complications more manageable), lower pneumothorax risk than subclavian.

**Disadvantages:** Higher infection risk than subclavian; head movement may cause catheter displacement; less patient comfort than subclavian for ambulatory patients.

**Ultrasound guidance for IJ:** NICE Technology Appraisal 49 (2002) and subsequent Cochrane reviews established ultrasound guidance as standard of care for IJ CVC insertion, reducing failed placement by 57% and arterial puncture by 71%.

### Subclavian Approach

The subclavian vein runs beneath the clavicle and is associated with the **lowest CLABSI rate** among CVC insertion sites in adults.

**Advantages:** Lowest CLABSI risk; most patient-comfortable site for long-term non-tunneled access; well-tolerated for ambulatory patients.

**Disadvantages:** Highest risk of pneumothorax and hemothorax at insertion; difficult to compress site if arterial puncture; technically more challenging with conventional landmark technique; real-time ultrasound guidance more technically demanding (infraclavicular approach).

**Site selection and CLABSI:** CDC 2011 guidelines and IDSA guidance recommend subclavian over femoral for reducing CLABSI. Institutional preference often favors IJ (ultrasound guidance is more practical); the subclavian advantage in infection reduction must be weighed against pneumothorax risk in specific patients.

### Femoral Approach

The femoral vein is readily accessible and carries the lowest immediate procedural complication risk (no pneumothorax risk), making it a useful emergency access site.

**Disadvantages:** Highest CLABSI rate among the three standard CVC sites; highest DVT risk; limited to bedbound patients; must be removed/exchanged when the patient becomes ambulatory or hemodynamically stable.

CDC guidelines recommend avoiding femoral access except when subclavian and IJ access are not feasible. If femoral access is used, remove and replace with a preferred site as soon as the clinical situation allows.

### Comparative CLABSI Risk by Site

| Site | Relative CLABSI Risk |
|---|---|
| Subclavian | Lowest |
| Internal Jugular | Intermediate |
| Femoral | Highest (2–3× subclavian) |

## Ultrasound-Guided CVC Insertion

Ultrasound guidance is standard of care for IJ CVC insertion in adult patients and is strongly recommended for subclavian (infraclavicular) insertion. It is not routinely required for femoral CVC in adults (anatomy is reliable without US) but improves success in obese patients.

**Real-time (dynamic) technique:**
1. Apply sterile probe cover and sterile ultrasound gel
2. Identify target vein (compressible, non-pulsatile) in short-axis view
3. Center vein on screen, guide needle insertion under real-time visualization
4. Confirm wire in vein before catheter insertion (long-axis view of wire, or use of Doppler)

See [Ultrasound-Guided Vascular Access](/guides/ultrasound-guided-vascular-access/) for the complete guide.

## Tunneled Central Venous Catheters

Tunneled CVCs are designed for long-term access (months to years). The catheter exits the skin at a separate site from the vein entry, running through a subcutaneous tunnel. The tunnel reduces infection risk by preventing direct bacterial migration from the skin entry point to the vein.

### Hickman and Broviac Catheters

Hickman (larger lumen, adult) and Broviac (smaller lumen, pediatric) catheters are open-ended silicone devices that exit from the chest wall. A **Dacron cuff** on the external portion promotes fibrous tissue ingrowth, anchoring the catheter and providing an additional infection barrier.

**Indications:** Long-term IV therapy, home parenteral nutrition, stem cell transplantation, bone marrow transplant.

**Maintenance:** Requires heparin locking when not in use; regular dressing changes at the exit site; repair kits available for catheter damage.

### Groshong-Tipped Catheters

Groshong catheters have a closed three-way valve at the tip that opens inward for blood aspiration, outward for infusion, and remains closed at rest. This design reduces blood reflux and eliminates the need for heparin locking.

**Advantages over open-ended:** No heparin required (saline lock acceptable); reduced risk of clotting and air embolism; cannot clamp the catheter (the valve provides the same function).

### Placement and Exit Site

Tunneled CVCs are placed by interventional radiologists, surgeons, or trained proceduralists using image guidance (fluoroscopy). The exit site is usually on the anterior chest below the clavicle, tunneled to a subclavian or IJ vein entry. Exit site care follows the same principles as non-tunneled CVC exit site care: CHG-impregnated dressing, regular assessment, ANTT for dressing changes.

## Implanted Vascular Access Ports

An implanted port consists of a **titanium or plastic reservoir** (the "port body") with a **self-sealing silicone septum** connected to a central venous catheter. The port body is surgically implanted in a subcutaneous pocket (typically upper chest). Access is achieved by penetrating the septum with a **non-coring Huber needle**.

### When Ports Are Preferred

- Patients requiring intermittent IV therapy over months to years (chemotherapy cycles, IV antibiotics for CF, long-term home PN)
- Patients who want minimal impact on body image and daily activities (ports are completely subcutaneous; no dressing required between accesses)
- Oncology patients: ports are preferred over PICCs for most long-term chemotherapy protocols
- The port reservoir can last 10+ years with proper care; the catheter may need replacement earlier

### Port Access Technique

Port access is a sterile procedure requiring ANTT:
1. Palpate the port septum and estimate depth
2. Prepare skin with CHG-alcohol antiseptic; allow to dry
3. Don sterile gloves; prepare sterile field
4. Stabilize port with non-dominant hand (two-finger method or dedicated port stabilizer)
5. Insert Huber needle **perpendicular (90°) to the septum** until the needle contacts the back wall of the reservoir
6. Confirm placement by aspirating blood return (brisk blood return expected)
7. Flush with 10 mL normal saline; observe site for swelling
8. Proceed with therapy

### Port Deaccessing

Deaccess using **positive-pressure technique**: flush with 20 mL NS (or per heparinized saline protocol), then withdraw the Huber needle while maintaining positive pressure on the syringe plunger. This prevents blood reflux into the port reservoir.

### Port Complications

- **Port pocket infection**: cellulitis or abscess overlying the port; requires antibiotics and possibly surgical drainage; severe cases require port explant
- **Port rotation or "flip"**: port body rotates within the pocket, preventing Huber needle access; requires imaging (CXR) to diagnose; surgical repositioning needed
- **Fibrin sheath**: same as other CVADs; managed with tPA
- **Needle dislodgment**: if Huber needle is not properly secured, it can dislodge during infusion, causing extravasation into chest tissue — particularly dangerous with vesicants

## Tunneled Hemodialysis Catheters

Hemodialysis patients require high-flow access (typically 300–450 mL/min) that cannot be achieved through standard CVCs. Tunneled hemodialysis catheters (TDCs) are dual-lumen (arterial + venous), high-flow, cuffed, tunneled catheters placed via the IJ vein, with the tip in the right atrium.

**When TDCs are used:**
- Bridging access while waiting for AV fistula maturation (typically 6–12 weeks after creation)
- Chronic hemodialysis in patients who are poor candidates for or have failed AV fistula/graft

**TDC limitations:** High CLABSI rate (among the highest of any vascular access device); dialysis catheter infection is a leading cause of bacteremia in dialysis patients. Per KDOQI guidelines, TDCs should be viewed as a bridge, with AV fistula as the preferred long-term access.

**TDC maintenance:** Heparin lock is required between dialysis sessions (typically 1,000 units/mL volume fill per catheter arm); some programs use citrate lock (30% trisodium citrate) as an antimicrobial and anticoagulant alternative.

## CVAD Tip Location Standards: CEVAD

Correct tip position is essential for CVAD function, patient safety, and regulatory compliance. An incorrectly positioned CVAD tip can cause arrhythmias, vessel erosion, cardiac tamponade, inadequate drug dilution, and malfunction.

### The CEVAD Consensus Position Statement

The **Consensus Document on the Optimal Tip Location of Central Venous Access Devices (CEVAD)**, developed by an international multidisciplinary expert panel (Pittiruti et al., 2019), establishes:

**Preferred tip location:** The **cavoatrial junction (CAJ)** — the transition zone between the superior vena cava and the right atrium. This position optimizes hemodilution of infusates, minimizes tip-related thrombosis, and avoids intracardiac complications.

**Acceptable range:** Lower one-third of the SVC, at or just above the CAJ.

**Unacceptable positions:**
- Proximal SVC or innominate vein (insufficient hemodilution for concentrated infusates)
- Internal jugular vein (malposition)
- Right atrium (arrhythmia risk, cardiac tamponade risk from long-term dwell)
- Right ventricle (serious arrhythmia risk)

### Tip Confirmation Methods

1. **Post-procedure CXR**: Most widely used. Tip ideally seen at the CAJ (approximately at the level of the right tracheobronchial angle or just below the carina on CXR; 1–2 cm below carina is often cited as a landmark approximation for CAJ).

2. **Intraprocedural ECG guidance (Sherlock 3CG, MIRUS, Nautilus)**: Electrode within the PICC guidewire detects P-wave morphology. As the tip approaches the sinoatrial (SA) node, P-wave amplitude increases; optimal CAJ position is characterized by a P-wave that is approximately 70–85% of the amplitude of the maximum P-wave (just above the peak). Validated accuracy >95%; increasingly becoming standard of care for PICC insertion.

3. **Fluoroscopy**: Gold standard; limited to IR suites or hybrid ORs.
