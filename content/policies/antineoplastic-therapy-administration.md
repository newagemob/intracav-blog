# Administration of Antineoplastic Therapy

## **1. Purpose and Scope**

This guideline establishes evidence-based standards for the safe preparation, handling, and administration of antineoplastic medications. It addresses occupational safety, patient assessment, medication verification, vascular access selection, and adverse reaction management. The recommendations apply across all healthcare settings where antineoplastic agents are used, including acute care facilities, ambulatory infusion centers, and home-based care environments.

Antineoplastic agents are classified as high-alert medications due to their narrow therapeutic index and potential for serious patient harm if administered incorrectly. These drugs also pose significant occupational hazards to healthcare workers through dermal absorption, inhalation, or accidental injection. The standards outlined herein aim to minimize risk to both patients and clinicians while ensuring therapeutic efficacy.

## **2. Prescribing and Order Entry Standards**

### **2.1 Authorization Requirements**

All antineoplastic medications must be ordered through written prescription or direct entry into a computerized prescriber order entry (CPOE) system by a licensed physician or authorized prescriber. This requirement exists because antineoplastic regimens involve complex dosing calculations based on body surface area, renal function, hepatic function, and cumulative exposure limits. Direct order entry allows for integrated clinical decision support, automatic dose checking, and reduction of transcription errors.

Verbal orders for antineoplastic agents are not permitted for initiation or modification of therapy. The sole exception applies when therapy must be placed on hold or discontinued urgently—situations where delay could compromise patient safety. In such cases, verbal orders must be documented and authenticated according to institutional policy and regulatory requirements.

### **2.2 Rationale for Restriction**

The restriction on verbal orders reflects the complexity and risk associated with antineoplastic prescribing. Errors in dose, schedule, or route can result in life-threatening toxicity or treatment failure. Electronic order entry systems provide safeguards including dose range checking, drug interaction screening, allergy verification, and cumulative dose tracking that are not available with verbal communication (Goldspiel et al., 2015).

## **3. Occupational Safety and Environmental Protection**

### **3.1 Hazardous Drug Classification**

Antineoplastic medications are classified as hazardous drugs based on their carcinogenic, teratogenic, genotoxic, or reproductive toxicity profiles. No threshold of occupational exposure has been established as safe. Healthcare workers who handle these agents without appropriate protection face increased risks of adverse health effects including skin disorders, reproductive abnormalities, and potentially malignancy (Crickman & Finnell, 2016).

### **3.2 Personal Protective Equipment Requirements**

All personnel involved in the preparation or administration of hazardous antineoplastic drugs must utilize personal protective equipment (PPE) specifically tested and approved for use with these agents. Standard examination gloves and isolation gowns do not provide adequate protection.

**Glove Selection and Use:** Gloves must meet ASTM International Standard D6978 for permeation resistance to chemotherapy drugs. Double gloving is required for all hazardous drug handling activities, as this practice significantly reduces the likelihood of skin contamination in the event of glove failure or permeation. Gloves should be changed immediately if torn, punctured, or visibly contaminated, and routinely every 30 minutes during continuous handling activities.

**Protective Gown Requirements:** Gowns must be single-use, disposable garments demonstrated to resist permeability to hazardous drugs. Required features include long sleeves with elastic or knit cuffs to prevent wrist exposure, back closure to avoid front contamination during donning and doffing, and seamless construction without closures that could permit drug passage. In sterile compounding environments, gowns must also meet sterility requirements.

**Respiratory Protection:** When the potential for inhalation exposure exists—such as during spill cleanup, powder reconstitution outside of engineering controls, or aerosol-generating procedures—respiratory protection is required. Acceptable options include NIOSH-approved N95 filtering facepiece respirators or powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs). Standard surgical masks do not provide protection against hazardous drug aerosols or vapors.

**Eye and Face Protection:** Safety glasses with side shields or face shields must be worn when there is potential for splashing, including during drug administration, port access, line disconnection, or spill management.

### **3.3 Engineering Controls**

Closed-system drug transfer devices (CSTDs) must be used whenever the dosage form permits. These devices mechanically prevent the escape of hazardous drug vapor or aerosol during preparation and administration, providing an additional layer of protection beyond PPE alone. When antineoplastic medications require rate titration or priming adjustments, tubing should be primed with the drug solution under a biosafety cabinet using a CSTD attached to the distal end to contain any expelled drug.

### **3.4 Environmental Safety Measures**

All areas where hazardous drugs are prepared or administered must be equipped with readily accessible spill kits, safety data sheets, PPE supplies, containment bags, and designated waste containers. Placing these materials at the point of use promotes consistent compliance with safety protocols (NIOSH, 2023).

Hazardous drug waste and all contaminated disposable equipment must be discarded in approved containers specifically labeled and designated for chemotherapy waste. These containers must meet regulatory requirements for hazardous pharmaceutical waste disposal.

### **3.5 Patient Body Fluid Precautions**

Antineoplastic drugs and their metabolites are excreted in patient body fluids including urine, feces, blood, emesis, sweat, and saliva. Healthcare workers and caregivers must employ appropriate precautions when handling these fluids or performing care activities where contact is anticipated for a minimum of 48 hours following drug administration. Some agents have extended excretion times beyond this standard window; pharmacy consultation should be obtained for specific drug information regarding metabolism and elimination (Olsen et al., 2023; Huff, 2020).

### **3.6 Transportation Safety**

Safe transport protocols must be followed when moving hazardous drugs between preparation areas and administration sites. Containers must be sealed, labeled, and transported in secondary containment to prevent environmental contamination in the event of breakage or leakage.

---

## **4. Clinician Competency Requirements**

Only clinicians who have completed specialized education and demonstrated competency in antineoplastic therapy administration may prepare or administer these medications. Competency programs must address drug classification and mechanisms of action, safe handling procedures, vascular access management, administration techniques, monitoring parameters, adverse reaction recognition and management, and emergency response protocols.

Competency must be validated initially and reassessed at defined intervals according to institutional policy. Documentation of education and competency verification must be maintained in personnel files (Neuss et al., 2016).

---

## **5. Patient Consent and Education**

### **5.1 Informed Consent**

Prior to initiating antineoplastic therapy, informed consent must be obtained and documented. The consent process must include a clear description of the proposed treatment, expected benefits and therapeutic goals, potential risks including common and serious adverse effects, available treatment alternatives including the option of no treatment, and the opportunity for the patient to ask questions and receive answers. Patients retain the right to accept or refuse treatment, and this right must be explicitly communicated (Vera et al., 2019).

### **5.2 Patient and Caregiver Education**

Assessment of the patient's understanding of their treatment is an ongoing process that begins before the first dose and continues throughout therapy. Education must address how the specific medications work, the treatment schedule and expected duration, potential side effects and strategies for management, signs and symptoms requiring immediate medical attention and contact information for reporting, and the physical and psychological effects the patient may experience.

For patients receiving therapy in the home setting, education must additionally cover safe disposal of all materials that contact antineoplastic medications, proper handling of patient body waste and contaminated laundry, and immediate care procedures for accidental skin or eye exposure (Olsen et al., 2023; Huff, 2020).

---

## **6. Pre-Treatment Assessment**

A comprehensive assessment must be completed before each treatment cycle. This evaluation ensures that the patient remains an appropriate candidate for therapy, that doses are correctly calculated, and that emerging toxicities are identified and managed.

### **6.1 Physical Parameters**

Accurate weight and height measurements are essential for body surface area calculation and dosing accuracy. Weight should be measured at least weekly for patients present in healthcare settings, as fluctuations may necessitate dose adjustments. Pretreatment vital signs establish a baseline for monitoring during and after administration.

### **6.2 Laboratory Evaluation**

Laboratory testing specific to the treatment regimen and individual patient must be reviewed before each cycle. Common assessments include complete blood count with differential to evaluate bone marrow function and detect cytopenias, serum creatinine and calculated creatinine clearance to assess renal excretion capacity, total bilirubin and hepatic transaminases to evaluate hepatic metabolism, serum electrolytes to identify imbalances requiring correction, and disease-specific or drug-specific tests such as hepatitis B serology, thyroid function panels, or serum cortisol as indicated by the treatment protocol. Laboratory values may be used to calculate doses, assess for toxicity from prior treatments, and confirm that the patient can adequately metabolize and excrete the prescribed agents (Kalo et al., 2019).

### **6.3 Medication Reconciliation**

A complete review of current medications must be performed, including prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, and complementary or alternative therapies. Consultation with the pharmacist is required to evaluate potential drug interactions whenever changes to the patient's medication list occur (Neuss et al., 2016).

### **6.4 Clinical History Review**

The assessment must include review of the patient's medical history and comorbidities that may affect treatment tolerance, substance use that may impact drug metabolism or adherence, immunization status, risk factors for acute infusion reactions, expected and unexpected side effects based on the specific regimen, new signs or symptoms of toxicity since the previous treatment, and documentation of allergies including medication, food, and environmental sensitivities.

### **6.5 Psychosocial Evaluation**

Assessment of the patient's understanding of their diagnosis and treatment plan, therapy goals and realistic expectations, support systems available to the patient, and planned frequency of treatments and follow-up visits supports treatment adherence and helps identify patients who may need additional resources (Olsen et al., 2023).

## **7. Medication Safety and Error Prevention**

### **7.1 High-Alert Medication Protocols**

Antineoplastic agents are universally classified as high-alert medications, requiring enhanced safeguards at every step from prescribing through administration. Organizations must implement systematic approaches to error prevention including standardized order sets with built-in dose limits, standardized dosage calculation methods with defined rounding rules, CPOE with integrated clinical decision support, independent dual verification at critical steps, barcode medication administration technology, and electronic infusion pumps with dose-error reduction systems (DERS or "smart pumps") (Goldspiel et al., 2015; Pfeiffer et al., 2020).

### **7.2 Verification Procedures**

Before administration, the clinician must verify that the treatment plan matches published standards for the regimen including dose, route, schedule, and rate. The medication label must be compared against the treatment plan and the original order. Patient identity must be confirmed using at least two unique identifiers, and pump programming must be verified against the order.

Patient and family involvement in the verification process is encouraged as a risk-reduction strategy. Patients often observe and report errors that may escape detection by healthcare workers (Kalo et al., 2019; Goldspiel et al., 2015).

### **7.3 Emergency Preparedness**

Orders for emergency treatment of potential adverse reactions must be obtained and available before drug administration begins. Emergency equipment and medications must be immediately accessible in all areas where antineoplastic therapy is administered.

### **7.4 Cumulative Dose Monitoring**

Certain antineoplastic agents have established maximum lifetime doses beyond which the risk of irreversible toxicity—particularly cardiotoxicity or pulmonary fibrosis—becomes unacceptable. Systems must be in place to track cumulative exposure and alert clinicians when limits are approached or reached (Neuss et al., 2016; Goldspiel et al., 2015).

### **7.5 Vinca Alkaloid Administration Safety**

Vinca alkaloids (vincristine, vinblastine, vinorelbine) must be dispensed for intravenous infusion only, prepared in minibags rather than syringes. This requirement exists to prevent inadvertent intrathecal administration, which is uniformly fatal. Syringes containing vinca alkaloids must never be prepared or present in any area where intrathecal medications are administered (Neuss et al., 2016).

### **7.6 Drug Integrity Verification**

The physical appearance and integrity of every antineoplastic medication must be assessed before administration. Drugs that appear discolored, contain particulate matter, or show evidence of container compromise must not be administered (Vera et al., 2019).

---

## **8. Vascular Access for Vesicant Administration**

Vesicant antineoplastic agents cause severe tissue destruction if extravasation occurs. Vascular access selection and monitoring during administration are critical safety measures.

### **8.1 Short Peripheral Intravenous Catheter Administration**

Vesicant antineoplastic medications may be administered through short peripheral intravenous catheters (PIVCs) under strictly controlled conditions (Olsen et al., 2023; Goldspiel et al., 2015; Ehmke, 2021; Kreidieh et al., 2016).

**Duration Limitations:** Only intravenous push injections or infusions lasting 30 minutes or less are appropriate for peripheral vesicant administration. The clinician must remain with the patient throughout the entire infusion.

**Pump Prohibition:** Infusion pumps must not be used for peripheral administration of vesicants. Pumps can continue to infuse despite extravasation, increasing the volume of drug deposited in tissue before detection.

**Catheter Age Restrictions:** Peripheral catheters that have been in place for more than 24 hours must not be used for vesicant administration. A new catheter must be inserted for each vesicant infusion.

**Site Selection:** Vein selection must prioritize large, smooth, palpable veins with straight pathways. The smallest catheter gauge adequate for the infusion should be used in the largest available vein. When vascular visualization technology is required for cannulation, veins with straight pathways must be selected.

The following sites must be avoided: the dorsal surface of the hand, the wrist area, the antecubital fossa, any area near a joint, lower extremities, sites distal to a recent venipuncture including laboratory draws, and any limb with impaired sensation, circulation, or lymphatic drainage, or with a history of lymph node dissection.

**Pediatric Considerations:** Scalp veins must not be used for vesicant administration in neonatal and pediatric patients.

**Failed Insertion Management:** If the initial insertion attempt is unsuccessful, subsequent attempts must be made proximal to the previous attempt or on the opposite extremity. Distal insertion following a failed proximal attempt risks extravasation at the damaged vein site.

### **8.2 Patient Risk Factor Assessment**

Before selecting peripheral access for vesicant administration, the clinician must assess patient-related extravasation risk factors including small or fragile veins, presence of lymphedema, obesity, impaired level of consciousness affecting the patient's ability to report symptoms, and history of multiple previous venipunctures (Boulanger et al., 2015).

### **8.3 Administration Technique for Peripheral Access**

The functional integrity of the vascular access device must be verified before vesicant administration. Patients must be informed of extravasation risks and instructed to immediately report any pain, burning, sensation changes, or feeling of fluid on the skin.

Blood return must be confirmed and documented before beginning vesicant administration. Vesicants must not be administered if blood return is absent or if any signs of infiltration are present. Administration should be provided through a free-flowing infusion of a compatible solution to provide dilution. For intravenous push administration, blood return must be assessed and verified every 2 to 5 mL. During infusions, blood return must be checked every 5 minutes and upon completion.

At the first sign of extravasation—including patient report of discomfort, observed swelling, or loss of blood return—the infusion must be stopped immediately and extravasation management protocols initiated.

### **8.4 Prohibited Peripheral Devices**

Long peripheral catheters and midline catheters must not be used for continuous infusions of antineoplastic vesicants. The tip locations of these devices do not permit reliable detection of extravasation, and tissue damage may be extensive before symptoms appear (Olsen et al., 2023).

### **8.5 Central Vascular Access Device Administration**

Central vascular access devices (CVADs) are preferred for vesicant administration, particularly for infusions exceeding 30 minutes or when peripheral access is compromised. However, extravasation can occur with central devices due to catheter malposition, thrombosis, or fibrin sheath formation (Olsen et al., 2023).

**Tip Position Verification:** For newly placed central catheters, tip position must be confirmed by radiography or other approved method before vesicant administration. Tip position should be reverified whenever catheter malposition is suspected based on clinical findings.

**Contraindications to Use:** Vesicants must not be administered through CVADs if signs of inflammation, swelling, or venous thrombosis are present. These conditions may indicate compromised catheter function or venous occlusion that could result in extravasation or inadequate drug delivery.

**Port Access Requirements:** When accessing implanted vascular access ports for vesicant administration, proper noncoring needle placement must be verified. The needle must be adequately secured and stabilized to prevent dislodgement during the infusion.

**Monitoring During Administration:** Blood return must be confirmed and documented before vesicant administration through CVADs. For intravenous push administration, blood return is assessed every 2 to 5 mL. For infusions, blood return is verified before initiation, during the infusion at intervals specified by organizational policy, and upon completion. Administration should be through a free-flowing compatible solution.

As with peripheral access, the infusion must be discontinued immediately at the first sign of extravasation.

## **9. Special Handling Considerations**

### **9.1 Air Removal from Tubing**

Air must not be aspirated from intravenous tubing containing hazardous drug solutions using a syringe. This practice creates negative pressure that can aerosolize drug solution or cause syringe contamination. Alternative methods for air removal that maintain closed system integrity must be used (Capoor & Bhowmik, 2017).

### **9.2 Spill Management**

Hazardous drug spills must be contained and cleaned immediately to minimize environmental contamination and worker exposure. Spill management must follow established protocols using appropriate spill kits and PPE. Areas where spills have occurred should be cleaned according to institutional policy before resuming normal operations (Olsen et al., 2023).

---

## **10. Adverse Reaction Monitoring and Management**

### **10.1 Types of Acute Reactions**

Patients receiving antineoplastic therapy may experience several categories of acute reactions that require immediate recognition and intervention. Distinguishing between reaction types can be challenging because symptoms frequently overlap.

**Acute Infusion Reactions** present with fever, shaking, chills, flushing, itching, dyspnea, back or abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin reactions, and fluctuations in heart rate or blood pressure. These reactions may be related to the drug itself, diluent components, or infusion rate.

**Hypersensitivity and Anaphylaxis** manifest as flushing, pruritus, urticaria (hives), angioedema, shortness of breath, wheezing, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension, oxygen desaturation, and in severe cases, cardiovascular collapse. These immune-mediated reactions require immediate intervention including discontinuation of the infusion and administration of emergency medications.

**Cytokine Release Syndrome** is characterized by fever, oxygen desaturation, hypotension, tachycardia, chills, nausea, anorexia, myalgia, headache, and rigors. This syndrome is particularly associated with certain immunotherapies and cellular therapies but may occur with other antineoplastic agents.

### **10.2 Patient Education and Monitoring**

Patients must be educated about the signs and symptoms of adverse reactions and instructed to report any concerning symptoms immediately during and after infusion. Continuous monitoring during infusion and appropriate post-infusion observation periods based on the specific agent and patient risk factors are essential for early detection and intervention (Olsen et al., 2023).

---

## **11. Documentation Requirements**

Complete documentation must accompany all aspects of antineoplastic therapy administration including verification of informed consent, pre-treatment assessment findings, laboratory values reviewed, vascular access device type, location, and functional status, blood return verification before, during, and after vesicant administration, infusion start and stop times, patient tolerance and any adverse reactions, interventions performed for adverse reactions or complications, and patient and caregiver education provided.
