# Prevention and Management of Air Embolism in Vascular Access

## **Clinical Significance**

Air embolism represents a potentially fatal complication of vascular access procedures and infusion therapy. When air enters the venous or arterial circulation, it can obstruct blood flow, leading to cardiopulmonary compromise, neurological injury, or death. The condition may arise during catheter insertion, routine infusion management, catheter exchange, or device removal. Prevention requires vigilant technique, appropriate equipment selection, and comprehensive education of all personnel involved in vascular access care.

Clinical events associated with air emboli have been documented across diverse procedural contexts, including contrast media administration, endoscopic procedures, guidewire-assisted interventions, sheath exchanges, arterial catheterization, neurosurgical procedures performed in upright positioning, cardiopulmonary bypass, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) circuits. Unsecured connections remain a common contributing factor across all settings.

## **Core Standards**

### **2.1 Connection Security**

All infusion system connections must incorporate luer-lock design to maintain secure attachment throughout therapy. This requirement applies universally to intravenous administration sets, syringes, needleless connectors, extension tubing, and any supplementary devices integrated into the infusion pathway. Luer-lock connections significantly reduce the risk of inadvertent disconnection that could permit air entry into the vascular system.

### **2.2 Air Removal Protocol**

Prior to initiating any infusion or connecting devices to a vascular access device, clinicians must completely purge air from all components of the administration system. This includes primary and secondary administration sets, syringes of any volume, needleless connectors, extension sets, and all add-on devices. No administration set containing air should be connected to any solution container or patient access point.

### **2.3 Education Requirements**

All individuals responsible for initiating or managing infusion therapy must receive comprehensive instruction covering three essential domains: recognition of air embolism signs and symptoms, implementation of preventive measures, and execution of critical emergency interventions when air embolism is suspected. This education requirement extends to clinical staff, patients receiving home infusion therapy, and designated caregivers who assist with infusion management.

## **Prevention Strategies**

### **3.1 General Prevention Measures for All Vascular Access Devices**

Effective prevention of air embolism requires systematic attention to equipment preparation, patient positioning, and connection management throughout the duration of vascular access therapy.

**Equipment Preparation:** Every administration set and add-on device must be completely primed before connection to the vascular access device. Unprimed administration sets should never remain attached to solution containers, as this practice creates opportunity for air introduction when the set is subsequently connected to the patient. Equipment featuring integrated safety mechanisms provides additional protection; clinicians should preferentially select administration sets incorporating air-eliminating filters and electronic infusion pumps equipped with air sensor technology.

**Connection Management:** The vascular access device must be clamped before any manipulation involving administration set changes or needleless connector replacement. This simple practice prevents air aspiration during the brief interval when the system is open. All connections throughout the infusion pathway should be verified for security at regular intervals and whenever the system is accessed.

**Patient and Caregiver Guidance:** Patients and caregivers managing infusion therapy outside clinical settings require explicit instruction regarding the dangers of disconnecting or reconnecting any portion of the infusion system without proper training. Only individuals who have demonstrated competency in intravenous administration techniques should perform these manipulations. Additionally, patients must understand that sharp objects such as scissors, hemostats, or razors should never be used near the catheter, as accidental laceration creates immediate risk of air entry.

### **3.2 Precautions During Central Vascular Access Device Procedures**

Insertion, exchange, and removal of central vascular access devices warrant heightened vigilance due to the proximity of these devices to central circulation and the larger caliber of the access pathway.

**Positioning Principles:** Patient positioning plays a critical role in preventing air entry during central line procedures. Positioning the patient so that the insertion or access site remains at or below the level of the heart reduces the pressure gradient that could draw air into the venous system. Air-occlusive techniques should be employed throughout insertion, use, maintenance, and removal procedures.

**Procedural Considerations:** Particular caution is warranted during catheter exchange procedures, sheath replacement, and any intervention requiring temporary opening of the vascular system. ECMO circuits present unique risks due to the high flow rates and multiple connection points inherent to extracorporeal circulation.

---

##

## **Central Vascular Access Device Removal Protocol**

Removal of central vascular access devices represents a high-risk interval for air embolism, even when the catheter has been in place for extended periods. The skin-to-vein tract that develops around indwelling catheters can persist after device removal, providing a potential pathway for air entry. Fibrin sheath formation along the catheter further complicates this risk.

### **4.1 Patient Positioning**

Position the patient supine or in Trendelenburg position (head lower than feet) during central catheter removal, provided these positions are tolerated. This positioning ensures the insertion site remains at or below heart level, reducing the negative intrathoracic pressure gradient that could aspirate air through the removal site. Trendelenburg positioning is contraindicated in premature neonates and may not be tolerated by patients with certain cardiac or respiratory conditions.

Although air embolism specifically attributed to peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) removal has not been documented in published literature, theoretical risk exists due to the potential for an intact skin-to-vein tract and fibrin sheath formation. The same positioning precautions applied to other central venous catheters should therefore be extended to PICC removal.

### **4.2 Valsalva Maneuver**

Instruct the patient to perform a Valsalva maneuver (bearing down against a closed glottis) during catheter withdrawal. This action increases intrathoracic pressure, creating a positive pressure gradient that opposes air entry into the venous system.<sup>44,45</sup>

The Valsalva maneuver is contraindicated in patients with supraventricular tachycardia, acute myocardial infarction, hemodynamic instability, aortic stenosis, carotid artery stenosis, glaucoma, or retinopathy. The maneuver produces significant increases in intra-abdominal and intrathoracic pressure that reduce cardiac output and alter blood pressure, making it potentially dangerous in these populations.

**Alternative Approaches:** When the Valsalva maneuver is contraindicated, place the patient in Trendelenburg position if tolerated. For patients who cannot tolerate Trendelenburg positioning, or for femoral catheter removal, use the supine position. In mechanically ventilated patients or those unable to follow instructions, time catheter removal to coincide with end expiration of the respiratory cycle.

### **4.3 Site Management After Removal**

Immediately upon catheter withdrawal, apply firm digital pressure using sterile dry gauze until complete hemostasis is achieved. Following hemostasis, apply petroleum-based ointment covered with gauze, then seal with a transparent semipermeable membrane dressing. This air-occlusive dressing should remain in place for a minimum of 24 hours to occlude the skin-to-vein tract and minimize risk of retrograde air embolism through the healing exit site.<sup>44,45</sup>

### **4.4 Post-Removal Activity Restriction**

Encourage patients to remain in a flat or reclining position for 30 minutes following catheter removal when feasible. This recommendation acknowledges that the exit site may be at or near heart level in certain positions, and the intact skin-to-vein tract may require time to seal sufficiently to prevent air entry.<sup>44,45</sup>

## **Recognition of Air Embolism**

Air embolism should be immediately suspected when any of the following signs or symptoms develop suddenly in a patient with vascular access, particularly in temporal association with catheter manipulation, connection changes, or device removal:

**Respiratory Manifestations:** Dyspnea, gasping respirations, persistent coughing, breathlessness, chest pain, wheezing, and tachypnea reflect the cardiopulmonary consequences of air obstructing pulmonary circulation.

**Cardiovascular Signs:** Hypotension and tachyarrhythmias indicate hemodynamic compromise resulting from impaired cardiac output or direct cardiac air lock.

**Neurological Symptoms:** Altered mental status, headache, seizures, speech changes, facial asymmetry or changes in facial appearance, numbness, and paralysis suggest cerebral air embolism, either through paradoxical embolism across a patent foramen ovale or direct arterial introduction.

The clinical presentation reflects the volume of air introduced, the rate of introduction, and whether the embolism affects the venous or arterial circulation. Venous air embolism primarily produces cardiopulmonary symptoms, while arterial air embolism can affect any end-organ, with cerebral manifestations being most clinically apparent.

##

## **Emergency Response Protocol**

### **6.1 Immediate Actions**

When air embolism is suspected, the first priority is preventing additional air from entering the circulation. If the vascular access device remains in place, immediately close, fold, clamp, or otherwise occlude the catheter. If the catheter has already been removed, cover the puncture site with an air-occlusive dressing or pad to seal the entry point.

### **6.2 Patient Positioning for Venous Air Embolism**

For suspected venous air embolism, immediately position the patient on their left side in Trendelenburg position (left lateral decubitus, head down). This positioning serves to trap air in the lower portion of the right ventricle, preventing it from entering the pulmonary circulation where it could cause complete obstruction. This position is contraindicated in patients with increased intracranial pressure, recent eye surgery, or severe cardiac or respiratory disease.

### **6.3 Patient Positioning for Arterial Air Embolism**

The management of arterial air embolism differs significantly from venous air embolism. Position the patient supine rather than in the left lateral position. The left lateral recumbent position does not prevent arterial air from entering systemic circulation, and head-down positioning may worsen cerebral edema in patients who have sustained cerebral air embolism.

### **6.4 Activation of Emergency Response**

In acute care settings, immediately activate the resuscitation team. In home care or alternative settings, call emergency medical services without delay. Concurrent with positioning interventions, clinicians should notify the responsible physician, ensure adequate vascular access for emergency medication administration, and initiate supplemental oxygen at 100% concentration if available. Support ventilation and circulation as clinically indicated.

### **6.5 Advanced Interventions**

Several advanced treatment modalities have demonstrated effectiveness in managing air embolism when available:

**Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy:** Reduces bubble size through increased ambient pressure and enhances tissue oxygenation. This therapy is particularly valuable for cerebral air embolism.

**Catheter Aspiration:** Direct aspiration of air through an indwelling central venous catheter may remove a portion of the air bolus before it distributes through the pulmonary circulation.

**Chest Compressions:** External chest compression may force air from larger pulmonary vessels into smaller arterial segments where it can be more readily absorbed, reducing the degree of circulatory obstruction.

##

## **Diagnostic Evaluation**

When air embolism is suspected based on clinical presentation, diagnostic confirmation may be sought through several imaging and monitoring modalities. Transesophageal echocardiography provides direct visualization of air in cardiac chambers and is highly sensitive for detecting venous air embolism. Precordial Doppler ultrasonography can detect characteristic signals produced by intracardiac air. Computed tomography demonstrates air in the vasculature and can identify end-organ injury. Magnetic resonance imaging may reveal cerebral infarction patterns consistent with air embolism. Electrocardiography may show ischemic changes or arrhythmias. Standard ultrasound examination can assist in evaluating cardiac function and identifying air.
