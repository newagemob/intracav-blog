# Biologic Therapy Administration

## **1. Purpose and Scope**

This guideline establishes evidence-based standards for the safe administration of biologic therapies, including colony-stimulating factors, gene therapies, monoclonal antibodies, fusion proteins, interleukin inhibitors, and immunoglobulins. The document addresses patient assessment, care setting selection, medication safety, and the management of adverse reactions.

---

## **2. Core Standards**

### **2.1 Clinical Monitoring Requirements**

Biologic therapies must be administered in clinical environments where trained personnel can provide continuous patient monitoring and respond immediately to severe adverse reactions. The administering clinician must possess competency in recognizing hypersensitivity reactions, infusion-related reactions, and anaphylaxis, and must have immediate access to emergency response equipment and medications.

### **2.2 Pre-Administration Assessment**

Prior to initiating any biologic therapy, clinicians must conduct a comprehensive assessment to identify contraindications and individual risk factors. This assessment must be repeated before each subsequent administration to detect any changes in patient status that may influence treatment safety or efficacy.

---

## **3. Safety Framework for Biologic Administration**

### **3.1 Medication Safety Practices**

Organizations must implement standardized safeguards across the entire medication use process to minimize the risk of adverse reactions and medication errors. These safeguards encompass prescribing protocols, storage requirements, dispensing procedures, and administration practices. Biologic agents are classified among high-alert medications due to their potential for significant patient harm when used in error (Institute for Safe Medication Practices, 2021).

### **3.2 Selection of Care Setting**

The administration setting for biologic therapy must be determined based on a systematic evaluation of patient-specific factors and the safety profile of the prescribed agent. Appropriate settings include hospital inpatient units, hospital outpatient infusion centers, provider offices, free-standing infusion suites, long-term care facilities, and the patient's home (Younger et al., 2016; Schleis et al., 2019).

The selected setting must ensure both patient safety and the clinical capacity to respond to adverse reactions. When home administration is considered, clinicians must conduct a formal risk assessment that evaluates the potential for adverse reactions and the feasibility of managing such events in the home environment. First doses administered at home require supervision by clinicians with specialized training in biologic therapy, immediate availability of medications to treat adverse reactions, and proximity to emergency medical services.

### **3.3 Drug Information and Biosimilar Considerations**

All clinicians involved in biologic therapy administration must have access to current, comprehensive drug information resources. When biosimilar products are prescribed, clinicians must verify the approved indication for use. Biosimilars are biologic products demonstrated to be highly similar to an FDA-approved reference product, with no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity, or potency. Unlike generic medications, biosimilars are not exact molecular duplicates of the reference product; rather, they must demonstrate chemical, functional, and clinical similarity through rigorous comparative studies (Cuellar et al., 2019).

### **3.4 Risk Evaluation and Mitigation**

Certain biologic agents carry serious risks that necessitate participation in FDA-mandated Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) programs. Clinicians must collaborate with the interdisciplinary healthcare team to ensure compliance with applicable REMS requirements (US Food and Drug Administration, n.d.).

For agents associated with elevated hypersensitivity risk, clinicians should anticipate premedication orders, which commonly include acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, and corticosteroids. Medications for treating anaphylaxis and other acute reactions must be immediately accessible at the point of care. Patient safety considerations should serve as the primary factor when determining the treatment setting (Rombouts et al., 2020; Yun et al., 2017; Kirchner, 2017).

---

## **4. Preparation, Storage, and Administration**

### **4.1 Medication Handling**

Biologic therapies must be stored, prepared, and administered in strict accordance with manufacturer specifications. Disposal of biologic waste must comply with jurisdictional regulations governing medical waste management.

Reconstitution and preparation must occur in a clean environment using Aseptic Non Touch Technique (ANTT®) principles. When the biologic agent is classified as hazardous, clinicians must utilize appropriate personal protective equipment throughout the handling and administration process (Olsen et al., 2023).

### **4.2 Infusion Delivery**

Selection of flow-control devices must account for multiple factors including rate control requirements, dosing parameters, infusion volume and duration, patient age and acuity, mobility needs, healthcare setting constraints, and the adverse effect profile of the specific therapy.

Inline filtration should be employed when specified by manufacturer instructions. For immunoglobulin therapy specifically, clinicians should avoid switching between product brands, as brand changes increase patient risk for adverse reactions (Younger et al., 2016).

---

## **5. Patient Assessment Protocol**

### **5.1 Baseline and Ongoing Assessment**

Comprehensive patient assessment is required before therapy initiation and must be repeated prior to each subsequent administration (Younger et al., 2016; Schleis et al., 2019; Kirchner, 2017; Waldron et al., 2022; Younger et al., 2015; Bayer et al., 2017).

**Risk factor identification** should address comorbid conditions, active or recent infections, complete allergy profile (including food, medication, and environmental allergies), prior exposure to biologic therapy with any associated reactions, tuberculosis testing results, malignancy history, recent weight changes, and hepatitis B and C screening results (Guo et al., 2018).

**Vaccination status** must be evaluated relative to the specific biologic agent, following manufacturer guidance and recommended intervals between vaccination and biologic therapy administration.

**Health status changes** must be identified before each administration, including disease progression, significant weight changes, acute illness, signs of infection, or gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea.

**Vital signs** must be obtained prior to administration and monitored at clinically appropriate intervals during and following the infusion.

**Laboratory monitoring** specific to the biologic therapy must be reviewed before treatment initiation and throughout the course of therapy as clinically indicated.

**Adverse reaction surveillance** must continue throughout the infusion and post-infusion observation period, with particular attention to hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis.

## **6. Subcutaneous Immunoglobulin Administration**

### **6.1 Standard Subcutaneous Immunoglobulin (SCIg)**

Self-administered subcutaneous immunoglobulin represents an appropriate option for eligible patients. Standard SCIg is typically infused at weekly or biweekly intervals using a subcutaneous pump with needle set, or administered daily via subcutaneous push technique. Hyaluronidase-facilitated SCIg products enable longer dosing intervals of three to four weeks using a subcutaneous infusion pump (Younger et al., 2015; Bayer et al., 2017; Health Quality Ontario, 2017; Olsen et al., 2019; Menon et al., 2022).

### **6.2 First-Dose Administration**

The initial SCIg dose must be administered in a clinical setting with immediate availability of medications for adverse reaction treatment and rapid access to emergency medical services.

### **6.3 Technical Parameters**

For standard SCIg products, infusion volume must not exceed 30 mL per injection site. Hyaluronidase-facilitated products may accommodate larger site volumes per manufacturer specifications. When multiple simultaneous injection sites are used, needle insertion points must be separated by a minimum of 2 inches (5 cm).

Flow control is typically achieved using a syringe pump, although manual push administration may be appropriate for selected patients based on the specific product, patient preference, and interdisciplinary team recommendation.

### **6.4 Patient and Caregiver Education**

Comprehensive education must address infection prevention principles, drug preparation techniques, required equipment, common side effects, proper subcutaneous administration technique, importance of injection site rotation, therapy adherence, recognition and reporting of local site reactions, and monitoring requirements during and after injection. Technical instruction must cover product preparation, pump setup and programming, administration technique, and appropriate supply disposal.

### **6.5 Local Reaction Prevention**

Strategies to minimize local site reactions include using a dry needle insertion technique to reduce dermatitis risk, initiating therapy with low volumes and gradual escalation, selecting needle gauge appropriate to the patient's subcutaneous tissue depth and mobility requirements, and applying ice packs following administration to relieve symptoms.

## **7. Intravenous Immunoglobulin Home Administration**

For patients with primary immune deficiency diseases who require extended therapy and have demonstrated clinical stability over time, nurse-administered home infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) represents a safe and effective care model (Zuizewind et al., 2018).

Evidence indicates that home administration enhances treatment outcomes through improved therapy adherence, reduced infection rates, and decreased cost per infusion compared with facility-based administration (Health Quality Ontario, 2017; Wasserman et al., 2017).

---

## **8. Patient and Caregiver Education Requirements**

Patients and caregivers must receive thorough education regarding all aspects of the prescribed biologic agent. Educational content must encompass the expected physical and psychological effects of therapy, potential adverse effects and their management, vaccination timing considerations relative to treatment, possible toxicities and their warning signs, and the potential for delayed reactions occurring after the administration session (Younger et al., 2016; Schleis et al., 2019; Kirchner, 2017; Bayer et al., 2017; Younger et al., 2015).

Clear guidance must be provided regarding self-management strategies for common adverse effects and explicit criteria for escalating concerns or contacting the healthcare team for additional assessment.
