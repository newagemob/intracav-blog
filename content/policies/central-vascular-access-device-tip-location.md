# Central Vascular Access Device Tip Location Policy

## 1. Policy Statement

It is the policy of this organization that every central vascular access device (CVAD) tip location shall be confirmed by an approved method prior to initiating infusion therapy and whenever clinical signs or symptoms suggest tip malposition. Acceptable tip positions are defined by evidence-based standards tailored to patient population and insertion site. Documentation of tip location shall be completed at the time of insertion and made available to all organizations involved in the patient's ongoing care. Suboptimal tip positioning shall be actively avoided and addressed when identified.

## 2. Purpose

This policy exists to:

- Define acceptable central vascular access device tip positions for all patient populations and insertion routes.
- Establish approved methods for tip location confirmation prior to initiating infusion therapy.
- Specify pre-insertion catheter length estimation requirements.
- Provide guidance on special considerations for neonates and infants.
- Define criteria for catheter use in patients transferred from external facilities.
- Establish documentation requirements for tip location confirmation.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to:

- All licensed clinical personnel involved in the insertion, confirmation, and management of central vascular access devices including peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs), centrally inserted central catheters (CVCs), tunneled catheters, and implanted ports.
- All patient populations, including adults, children, neonates, and infants.
- All inpatient, procedural, ambulatory, and home care settings in which CVADs are placed or managed.
- All transferred patients arriving with CVADs placed at external facilities.

## 4. Policy Requirements

### 4.1 Tip Confirmation Standards

4.1.1 Central vascular access device tip location shall be confirmed radiographically or through an approved alternative imaging or technology-based method prior to initiating infusion therapy via a newly placed CVAD.

4.1.2 Tip confirmation shall be repeated whenever clinical signs or symptoms suggest tip malposition, including but not limited to: unexplained infusion resistance, pain or discomfort during infusion, arrhythmia occurring during or after insertion, lack of blood return, or patient complaint of neck, shoulder, or ear discomfort during infusion.

4.1.3 Documentation of the original catheter tip location shall be entered in the patient's health record immediately following confirmation and shall be accessible to all organizations and providers involved in the patient's care, including during transfers.

### 4.2 Optimal Tip Position

4.2.1 For adults and children, the safest CVAD tip location is the superior (for upper limb insertion) or inferior (for lower limb insertion) cavoatrial junction.[^1]

4.2.2 For upper body insertion sites, the catheter tip shall reside in the lower third of the superior vena cava or upper third of the right atrium at or near the cavoatrial junction. The following malpositions shall be actively avoided:

- **Distal malposition:** Positioning deep in the right atrium near the tricuspid valve or into the right ventricle is associated with cardiac arrhythmias and must be corrected.
- **Proximal malposition:** Positioning in the mid or upper superior vena cava, subclavian, or brachiocephalic vein increases thrombosis risk and impairs delivery of hyperosmolar or vasoactive infusions.

4.2.3 Respiratory variation and arm movement cause tip migration in caudal or cephaloid directions. These physiologic shifts shall be accounted for in tip positioning decisions.

4.2.4 For lower body insertion sites, the catheter tip shall be positioned in the inferior vena cava above diaphragm level.

4.2.5 Hemodialysis CVADs shall be positioned with the tip at mid-right atrium to prevent vessel and right atrial trauma, in accordance with KDOQI vascular access guidelines.[^2]

4.2.6 Suboptimal tip position shall be corrected prior to initiating therapy except in rare circumstances involving anatomical or pathophysiological changes where alternative positions are clinically indicated and documented.

### 4.3 Special Considerations for Neonates and Infants

4.3.1 Intracardiac catheter tip location is contraindicated in neonates and infants under one year of age. Intracardiac positioning in this population is associated with vessel erosion and cardiac tamponade, including with catheter sizes smaller than 3 French.[^3][^4][^5]

4.3.2 Tip positioning for neonates and infants shall target a position above the right atrium. Cardiac silhouette reference points on radiograph shall be used in conjunction with clinical assessment and real-time confirmation methods when available.

4.3.3 Tip location shall be re-confirmed when growth, repositioning, or clinical change may have caused catheter tip migration.

### 4.4 Pre-Insertion Catheter Length Estimation

4.4.1 Accurate catheter length approximation shall be performed prior to insertion using approved anthropometric measurement techniques. Acceptable methods include:

- External measurement from the planned insertion site to the third intercostal space[^6][^7]
- Calculation formulas based on body surface area (appropriate for pediatric populations)
- Measurement reference from pre-procedural chest radiograph when available

4.4.2 Pre-insertion length estimates shall be documented in the procedural record. Actual insertion length and external catheter length at confirmation shall also be recorded.

### 4.5 Approved Real-Time Tip Location Methods

4.5.1 Real-time tip location methods employed during insertion demonstrate greater accuracy, more efficient therapy initiation, and reduced costs compared to post-procedure radiographic confirmation alone. These methods are preferred when available and clinically appropriate.

4.5.2 **Electrocardiogram (ECG) guidance** is the primary real-time tip location method endorsed by this organization. ECG guidance uses either a metal guidewire or a column of normal saline within the catheter lumen to transmit the intravascular ECG signal, enabling clinicians to position the tip at the cavoatrial junction by observing characteristic changes in P wave morphology.[^8][^9][^10][^11]

4.5.3 Prior to employing ECG tip location technology, the clinician shall assess for contraindications including:
- Cardiac dysrhythmias with absent or altered P waves
- Pacemaker dependence resulting in absence of intrinsic P wave activity
- Extreme tachycardia interfering with P wave identification

4.5.4 ECG-guided tip confirmation may be used in patients with atrial fibrillation, provided the clinician accounts for altered P wave morphology and uses available ECG tracings accordingly.[^12][^13][^14][^24]

4.5.5 **Ultrasound** may serve as an emerging alternative for tip location confirmation in select clinical contexts. Its effectiveness varies with operator knowledge, skill, and experience. Agitated saline enhancement via transthoracic echocardiography may improve detection accuracy. Ultrasound tip confirmation is particularly applicable in neonates and critical care environments where immediate confirmation is time-sensitive.[^15][^16][^17][^18][^19][^20][^22][^23]

4.5.6 **Fluoroscopy** serves as an alternative when bedside placement is difficult or when other real-time methods fail or are contraindicated.[^21]

4.5.7 When an approved real-time tip location method confirms appropriate placement, post-procedure chest radiograph is not required unless clinically indicated. Most evidence supporting this practice is specific to PICCs; clinical judgment shall govern application to other CVAD types.[^8]

4.5.8 Neither radiographic nor ECG technology differentiates between venous and arterial placement. When arterial placement is suspected, additional confirmation methods shall be used before initiating any infusion.

### 4.6 Re-Evaluation of Tip Position

4.6.1 Catheter tip position shall be re-evaluated when clinical signs or symptoms suggest malposition (see Section 4.1.2).

4.6.2 Prior to initiating infusion therapy following a period of catheter non-use, tip position verification via ECG, ultrasound, or post-procedure chest radiograph shall be performed if clinical uncertainty exists regarding tip position.

### 4.7 Transferred Patients with Existing CVADs

4.7.1 When a patient is transferred from an external healthcare facility with a CVAD in place, catheter use without additional tip confirmation is permissible only when all of the following criteria are simultaneously met:

- Documentation confirms tip position in the lower third of the superior vena cava, cavoatrial junction, or superior right atrium at insertion
- Blood can be aspirated freely and catheter flushes without resistance
- External catheter length matches insertion documentation

4.7.2 When any criterion in 4.7.1 is not met, a chest radiograph shall be obtained to confirm tip placement before initiating therapy.

### 4.8 Documentation Requirements

4.8.1 Complete tip location documentation shall include all of the following:

- Time and date of insertion
- Pre-insertion catheter length estimate and method used
- Actual insertion length and external catheter length at time of confirmation
- Confirmation method used (ECG, radiograph, ultrasound, or fluoroscopy)
- Specific tip location (e.g., "lower third of the SVC at the cavoatrial junction")
- ECG tracing, chest radiograph report, or other confirmation record incorporated into the health record
- Name and credentials of the clinician confirming tip position

4.8.2 Documentation shall be entered in the electronic health record and available to all providers involved in ongoing patient care, including during care transitions.

## 5. Compliance

5.1 **Monitoring.** Compliance shall be monitored through:
- Audit of CVAD insertion records for tip confirmation documentation completeness
- Review of time-to-therapy-initiation following CVAD insertion
- Tracking of tip malposition rates and required repositioning events
- Review of adverse events associated with tip malposition (arrhythmia, vessel erosion, tamponade)
- Transfer patient catheter use documentation review

5.2 **Key Performance Indicators.**
- Tip confirmation documentation compliance (target: 100% of CVAD insertions)
- Tip malposition rate requiring repositioning before therapy (target: <5%)[^25]
- Time to infusion therapy initiation from CVAD insertion (tracked and trended)
- Adverse events related to tip malposition (target: zero preventable events)

5.3 **Enforcement.** Initiation of infusion therapy via a CVAD without documented tip confirmation is a patient safety violation. Clinicians who initiate therapy without confirmed tip location shall be subject to immediate review and remediation. Recurring violations shall be escalated through clinical governance and performance management processes.

## 6. Exceptions

6.1 In life-threatening emergencies, infusion therapy may be initiated prior to tip confirmation when the clinical urgency is documented and the benefit is deemed to exceed the risk. Emergency use shall be documented in the health record, and tip confirmation shall occur at the earliest safe opportunity.

6.2 Exceptions to neonatal intracardiac tip avoidance require attending physician authorization and explicit documentation of the clinical indication.
