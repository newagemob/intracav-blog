# Informed Consent for Vascular Access Procedures Policy

## 1. Policy Statement

It is the policy of this organization that informed consent shall be obtained, as a process and not merely a signature, before any vascular access procedure for which consent is required by law, regulation, or organizational policy. The consent process shall ensure that the patient (or their legally authorized representative) understands the nature of the proposed procedure, the associated risks and benefits, the available alternatives, and has the opportunity to ask questions and receive answers in a language they understand before granting or withholding permission. Documentation of the consent process shall be recorded in the patient's health record.

## 2. Purpose

This policy exists to:

- Protect patient autonomy by ensuring that every patient has the right to make informed decisions about invasive vascular access procedures performed on their body.
- Define the required components of the informed consent discussion for vascular access procedures to ensure legal defensibility and ethical compliance.
- Establish documentation standards that demonstrate the consent process was conducted, understood, and voluntarily agreed to.
- Define the requirements for obtaining consent in emergency situations where the patient is unable to participate in the consent process.
- Establish the requirements for surrogate decision-making when the patient lacks decision-making capacity.
- Protect the organization and its clinicians from liability by ensuring that the consent process meets or exceeds all applicable legal and regulatory standards.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to:

- All clinicians who perform or order vascular access procedures requiring informed consent.
- All vascular access procedures for which informed consent is required by organizational policy, including but not limited to: PICC insertion, central venous catheter insertion (tunneled and non-tunneled), implanted port placement and access, intraosseous device insertion, and any other invasive vascular access procedure designated by the Medical Staff as requiring formal consent.
- Peripheral IV insertion does not typically require a separate formal written consent form, as it is generally considered part of the consent to treatment obtained at admission. However, the clinician shall still explain the procedure to the patient and obtain verbal agreement before proceeding. This requirement does not apply in emergent situations.
- All clinical settings within the organization.

## 4. Policy Requirements

### 4.1 Legal and Ethical Requirements

4.1.1 Informed consent is both a legal requirement and an ethical obligation rooted in the principle of patient autonomy. The consent process shall ensure that the patient's decision is: **informed** (based on adequate disclosure of relevant information), **voluntary** (free from coercion, undue influence, or manipulation), and made by an individual with **capacity** (the cognitive ability to understand the information, appreciate its significance, reason about the options, and communicate a choice).

4.1.2 **Who May Obtain Consent.** Informed consent for vascular access procedures shall be obtained by the clinician who will perform the procedure, or by a designated subject matter expert who is qualified to explain the procedure, its risks, and the alternatives. The organization shall define, through Medical Staff bylaws or policy, which clinician categories are authorized to obtain consent for specific vascular access procedures.

4.1.3 **Language and Communication.** The consent discussion shall be conducted in the patient's preferred language. When the patient's preferred language differs from the clinician's, qualified interpreter services (in-person or via telephone/video) shall be used. Family members and untrained staff shall not serve as interpreters for consent discussions. For patients with hearing, visual, or other communication impairments, appropriate accommodations shall be provided.

### 4.2 Components of the Informed Consent Discussion

4.2.1 The clinician obtaining consent shall discuss the following elements with the patient or their legally authorized representative:

**Description of the Procedure.** A clear, jargon-free explanation of the vascular access device being proposed, where it will be placed in the body, how it will be inserted (including the use of imaging guidance such as ultrasound or fluoroscopy if applicable), and what the patient can expect to experience during the procedure (including pain management measures).

**Benefits of the Procedure.** An explanation of why this device is being recommended, what clinical objectives it will enable (e.g., delivery of medications, nutrition, or blood products that cannot be safely administered through other means), and the anticipated duration of use.

**Risks and Potential Complications.** A transparent, honest discussion of the material risks associated with the proposed procedure, tailored to the specific device type. Risks to be discussed include, but are not limited to: infection (local and bloodstream), bleeding or hematoma, venous thrombosis (local and deep vein thrombosis), nerve injury, arterial puncture, pneumothorax or hemothorax (for central lines placed via the subclavian or internal jugular approach), catheter malposition, catheter embolization, air embolism, cardiac arrhythmia during insertion, allergic reaction to materials or medications used during the procedure, and the possibility that the procedure may not be successful and may need to be repeated or an alternative approach used.

**Alternatives.** A discussion of the available alternatives to the proposed procedure, including different types of vascular access devices that could be used, alternative routes of medication administration (e.g., oral, intramuscular, subcutaneous), and the option of refusing the procedure entirely. The clinician shall explain the relative advantages and disadvantages of each alternative.

**Consequences of Refusal.** A clear explanation of the potential consequences of declining the procedure, including the inability to deliver prescribed therapy, delays in treatment, and any increased risk to the patient's health or life.

**Questions.** The patient or representative shall be given an explicit opportunity to ask questions and shall receive answers in a manner they can understand. The clinician shall assess comprehension before concluding the discussion.

### 4.3 Documentation of Consent

4.3.1 The health record shall contain documentation that demonstrates the informed consent process occurred. This documentation shall include, at minimum:
- The date and time the consent discussion took place.
- The name and credentials of the clinician who conducted the consent discussion.
- The specific procedure for which consent is being obtained.
- A statement that the components of the consent discussion (procedure description, benefits, risks, alternatives, consequences of refusal, and opportunity for questions) were addressed.
- The name of the patient or legally authorized representative who participated in the discussion.
- A statement that the patient or representative expressed understanding and voluntarily granted permission to proceed.
- The patient's or representative's signature (or electronic equivalent) on the organization's consent form, witnessed as required by policy.
- If an interpreter was used, the name of the interpreter and the language used.

4.3.2 **Consent Form.** The organization shall maintain a standardized Informed Consent Form for vascular access procedures that includes all required elements and is approved by Legal Counsel and the Medical Staff Office.

4.3.3 **Timing.** Consent shall be obtained sufficiently in advance of the procedure to allow the patient adequate time for deliberation. Consent obtained while the patient is in a state of acute distress, under the influence of sedating medications, or immediately before being transported to the procedure area raises concerns about voluntariness and capacity and should be avoided when possible.

### 4.4 Emergency Situations

4.4.1 In emergency situations where a vascular access procedure is immediately necessary to preserve the patient's life or prevent serious harm, and the patient is unable to participate in the consent process (e.g., unconscious, incapacitated), and a legally authorized representative is not available within the timeframe required for treatment, the procedure may proceed without formal written consent under the emergency exception to informed consent.

4.4.2 **Emergency Documentation.** When the emergency exception is invoked, the health record shall document: the nature of the emergency, the specific threat to the patient's life or health that necessitated immediate intervention, the attempts made to contact a legally authorized representative, the clinical rationale for proceeding without consent, and the names of the clinicians involved in the decision.

4.4.3 As soon as the emergency has stabilized, the treating team shall inform the patient (if they have regained capacity) or their legally authorized representative of the procedure performed and the circumstances, and shall obtain retroactive consent or document the discussion.

### 4.5 Patients Lacking Decision-Making Capacity

4.5.1 When a patient lacks decision-making capacity (as assessed by the treating physician or a qualified designee), consent shall be obtained from the patient's legally authorized representative, as defined by applicable state law. The hierarchy of surrogate decision-makers shall follow the organization's Surrogate Decision-Making Policy, which reflects state-specific legal requirements.

4.5.2 The surrogate decision-maker shall receive the same informed consent discussion as would be provided to the patient, and their authorization shall be documented in the same manner.

4.5.3 **Assent from Incapacitated Patients.** Even when consent is provided by a surrogate, the treating clinician shall, to the extent possible, explain the procedure to the patient and seek their assent (agreement) before proceeding.

### 4.6 Refusal of Consent

4.6.1 A patient with decision-making capacity has the right to refuse any vascular access procedure, even if refusal may result in adverse clinical outcomes. The refusal shall be respected.

4.6.2 When a patient refuses a recommended vascular access procedure, the clinician shall: ensure the patient understands the potential consequences of refusal, explore the patient's concerns and address them to the extent possible, document the refusal, the information provided to the patient about consequences, and the patient's stated understanding, offer alternative approaches if available, and notify the ordering provider.

## 5. Compliance

5.1 **Monitoring.** Compliance shall be monitored through retrospective chart audits of consent documentation completeness for all procedures requiring formal written consent (conducted quarterly by Quality/Risk Management), review of patient complaints or grievances related to the consent process, tracking of emergency consent exception utilization, and concurrent observation of consent discussions by Clinical Education or Quality staff during audit periods.

5.2 **Key Performance Indicators.**
- Informed consent documentation completion rate for applicable vascular access procedures (target: 100%).
- Percentage of consent forms containing all required elements (target: 100%).
- Patient complaints related to the consent process (target: zero).
- Emergency consent exception utilization rate with complete documentation (target: 100% documentation for all exceptions invoked).

5.3 **Enforcement.** Performing an elective vascular access procedure requiring formal consent without documented informed consent is a serious policy violation. Violations shall be reported to Risk Management and the Chief Medical Officer and may result in restriction of procedural privileges, mandatory re-education, and progressive disciplinary action.

## 6. Exceptions

6.1 The only exception to the requirement for written informed consent is the emergency exception defined in Section 4.4, which is itself subject to rigorous documentation requirements.

6.2 Procedures for which separate written consent is not required (e.g., routine peripheral IV insertion) remain subject to the requirement for verbal explanation and patient agreement as described in Section 3.
