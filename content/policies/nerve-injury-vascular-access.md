# Prevention and Management of Nerve Injury in Vascular Access

## **Understanding Nerve Injury Risk**

Nerve injury during vascular access procedures, while relatively uncommon, represents a significant clinical concern with potentially lasting consequences for patients. Anatomical variations in veins, arteries, and nerves occur frequently across the population, meaning that even experienced clinicians cannot rely solely on expected anatomy when performing these procedures.[^1][^2][^3]

### **Peripheral Venous Access Sites**

Certain anatomical locations carry elevated risk for nerve damage during peripheral venous access. The cephalic vein at the radial wrist poses a particular hazard due to its proximity to the superficial radial nerve. Similarly, the volar (inner) aspect of the wrist places the median nerve at risk of injury. At and above the antecubital fossa, multiple neural structures may be affected, including the median nerve, anterior interosseous nerve, and both the lateral and medial antebrachial nerves.[^4][^5][^6][^7][^3][^8][^9][^10][^11][^12][^13][^14][^15][^16][^17][^18][^19][^20][^21][^22]

### **Peripheral Arterial Access Sites**

Arterial catheterization carries its own set of neurological risks. The brachial artery lies in close anatomical relationship with the median nerve, making this site particularly hazardous. Radial artery access may result in injury to either the median nerve or the radial nerve.[^23][^24][^25]

### **Central Vascular Access Devices**

Although nerve injuries associated with CVADs occur rarely, documented cases involving axillary, subclavian, and internal jugular insertion sites have resulted in phrenic nerve injury, brachial plexus damage, and Horner's syndrome. These complications, while infrequent, demand vigilant clinical awareness.[^14][^21][^26][^27][^28][^29][^30][^31][^32][^33]

# Strategies for Risk Reduction

### **Minimizing Venipuncture Attempts**

Multiple venipuncture attempts significantly increase the probability of nerve injury. Repeated peripheral and central venous access attempts, subcutaneous probing techniques, and multiple needle passes have all been associated with heightened risk.[^8][^12][^15][^21][^29][^33] Clinicians should therefore approach each access attempt with careful planning and appropriate resources to maximize first-attempt success.

### **Ultrasound Guidance**

Ultrasound-guided insertion represents a primary strategy for improving first-time insertion success while simultaneously allowing visualization of veins, arteries, and associated structures including nerves. This technology is particularly valuable when placing short or long peripheral catheters in patients with difficult intravenous access, when inserting peripheral arterial catheters, CVADs, and midline catheters.[^13][^16][^17][^23][^24][^29][^32][^34][^35][^36][^37][^38][^39]

### **Insertion Angle Considerations**

When inserting a phlebotomy needle or peripheral intravenous catheter without ultrasound guidance, clinicians must assess vein depth and select an appropriate insertion angle. Steep angles increase the risk of penetrating the posterior vein wall and damaging underlying structures. For shallow veins and the veins of older adults, an angle of 5° to 15° is generally appropriate. Deeper veins may require steeper angles, but this should be approached cautiously.[^5][^20][^40]

### **Preferred Phlebotomy Sites**

For routine phlebotomy, the median cubital vein and the cephalic vein (excluding the first quarter of the forearm above the wrist) represent preferred sites. These veins are positioned closer to the skin surface and in anatomical locations where nerve damage and brachial artery puncture are less likely to occur.[^5][^6][^3][^13][^20]

Conversely, the medial and lateral portions of the antecubital fossa—specifically the basilic and median basilic veins—should be avoided due to their proximity to the median nerve and brachial artery. Injury to the median nerve in this region can result in loss of extension, flexion, and sensation in the hand and forearm.

The cephalic vein in the first quarter of the forearm (the region immediately above the wrist) should also be avoided.[^4][^9][^11]

### **Needle Stabilization During Phlebotomy**

Needle movement during blood collection procedures increases the risk of neural contact and injury. Clinicians should use appropriate technique to minimize needle movement while attaching and removing blood collection tubes.[^5][^20][^41]

# Recognizing and Responding to Nerve Injury

### **Immediate Response to Paresthesia**

When a patient reports symptoms consistent with direct puncture nerve injury—including paresthesia, radiating electrical pain, tingling, burning, prickly sensations, or numbness—the clinician must immediately stop the insertion procedure and carefully remove the VAD or phlebotomy needle. The procedure should also be discontinued upon patient request or when patient behavior indicates severe pain.[^6][^7][^15][^21]

Following such an event, the responsible provider must be promptly informed of the patient's symptoms. Early recognition and intervention substantially improve prognosis for nerve injury. Consultation with an appropriate specialist, such as a hand specialist or neurologist, may be required. Importantly, the majority of venipuncture-related nerve injuries resolve within six months.[^15][^16][^19][^21]

### **Nerve Compression and Compartment Syndrome**

Nerve compression injuries can develop through several mechanisms, and prevention requires attention to multiple factors. Infiltration and extravasation must be detected early to limit the volume of solution entering surrounding tissue. Bleeding at attempted and successful access sites must be controlled to prevent hematoma formation, which can compress adjacent nerves. Patients receiving anticoagulant therapy face elevated hematoma risk and require additional vigilance.[^12][^29][^33][^42]

Any VAD should be removed immediately when a patient reports pain, neuropathy, or weakness in the affected extremity during dwell time. Nerve injury following peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) insertion has been documented in the literature. Nerve compression can result from infiltrated intravenous solutions, hematoma, and edema associated with the inflammatory process of phlebitis and thrombophlebitis.[^7][^43][^44][^45]

The classic signs and symptoms of compartment syndrome include pain, pallor, paresthesia, paralysis, and pulselessness, with pain typically progressing from paresthesia to paralysis. Pallor and loss of peripheral pulse indicate advanced compartment syndrome. This condition constitutes a surgical emergency requiring fasciotomy within hours to prevent loss of the affected extremity. Clinicians should be aware that the hand contains numerous anatomical compartments compared to the wrist or forearm.[^42][^46][^47]

Risk factors for compartment syndrome from intravenous infiltration, while the condition itself is rare, include contrast media administration, pressurized infusion delivery, and patients with communication barriers such as those younger than three years old, patients with impaired sensation, and those with altered mentation.[^45]

# Special Clinical Considerations

### **Phrenic Nerve Injury**

Subclavian and jugular insertion sites can produce damage to the phrenic nerve, which manifests on chest radiograph as an elevated right hemidiaphragm. Associated findings may include right shoulder and neck pain, distended neck veins, and hiccups. Phrenic nerve injury can result from direct trauma associated with multiple needle insertions, compression from the catheter itself, intraventricular tip locations, hematoma, and infiltration or extravasation of infusing solutions. When phrenic nerve injury is identified, CVAD removal is indicated.[^30][^32]

### **Horner's Syndrome**

PICCs and catheters inserted via the internal jugular vein have been associated with vision-related changes suggestive of cervical sympathetic nerve inflammation, a constellation of findings known as Horner's syndrome. Clinical indicators include pupil constriction (miosis) and upper eyelid drooping (ptosis).[^28][^29]

Risk reduction strategies for Horner's syndrome include ultrasound-guided insertion, avoiding excessive head rotation during skin puncture, minimizing repeated insertion attempts, avoiding steep needle-to-skin angles during insertion, and applying appropriate compression to prevent hematoma formation following inadvertent carotid artery injury.

### **Complex Regional Pain Syndrome**

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) represents a chronic, debilitating condition characterized by ongoing neuropathic pain over a regional area. The pain is typically disproportionate to the original injury and progressively incorporates sensory, motor, and autonomic changes. Venipuncture-induced CRPS, while rare, presents diagnostic challenges because this syndrome frequently spreads to extremities that were not directly traumatized. Affected patients may require lifelong management including multiple pain medications, corticosteroids, nerve blocks, physical therapy, and surgical interventions such as sympathectomy.[^48][^49]
