# Strategic Planning and Implementation of Vascular Access Services Policy

## 1. Policy Statement

It is the policy of this organization that vascular access and infusion therapy services shall be delivered through a strategically planned, sustainably funded, and professionally governed program led by dedicated vascular access specialists operating within an interprofessional leadership framework. The organization shall conduct rigorous, data-driven evaluations of its clinical outcomes, operational challenges, and financial expenditures related to infusion services and shall use these evaluations to guide program design, staffing, resource allocation, and continuous improvement.

## 2. Purpose

This policy exists to:

- Mandate organizational assessment of the value proposition of dedicated vascular access specialist services, including measurable impacts on complication reduction, infection control, clinical optimization, financial performance, and patient experience.
- Establish the governance structure, leadership composition, and accountability framework for vascular access services.
- Define the requirements for team identity, nomenclature, and professional scope that reflect the comprehensive nature of modern vascular access care.
- Integrate vascular access services into the organization's formal budgetary and financial planning processes to ensure long-term sustainability.
- Require the integration of vascular access expertise into broader institutional safety programs, including antimicrobial stewardship, infection prevention, medication safety, pain management, extravasation prevention, and infusion pump safety.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to:

- Organizational leadership, including the Chief Nursing Officer, Chief Medical Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Vice Presidents of Clinical Operations, and Department Directors responsible for infusion services.
- All members of the Vascular Access Governance Committee and the Vascular Access Specialist Team.
- Supply Chain, Finance, Human Resources, Quality/Safety, Infection Prevention, and Pharmacy departments insofar as they intersect with vascular access program planning, funding, and quality oversight.
- All clinical settings where vascular access services are delivered, including inpatient, outpatient, and affiliated community care settings.

## 4. Policy Requirements

### 4.1 Organizational Assessment and Value Proposition

4.1.1 The organization shall conduct a comprehensive baseline assessment of its vascular access clinical outcomes, operational workflows, and financial expenditures at minimum every three (3) years, or whenever a significant structural change to infusion services is proposed (e.g., team expansion, team dissolution, service line addition or reduction).

4.1.2 The assessment shall include, at minimum:
- **Complication rates:** Incidence of central vascular access device (CVAD) complications including arterial puncture, pneumothorax, hemothorax, catheter malposition, and catheter-associated bloodstream infection (CABSI).
- **Infection control metrics:** CABSI rates per 1,000 central line days, benchmarked against NHSN national data.
- **Clinical optimization indicators:** Rate of unnecessary CVAD placements (patients receiving CVADs when peripheral access was sufficient), first-attempt insertion success rates, and DIVA consultation volume and outcomes.
- **Financial analysis:** Total cost of vascular access-related adverse events, labor costs, equipment and supply expenditures, and revenue generated by outpatient procedures.
- **Patient experience metrics:** Patient satisfaction scores related to vascular access encounters, complaint volume, and first-attempt success rates.

4.1.3 The organization shall not reduce or eliminate dedicated vascular access specialist services without first completing a prospective impact analysis that models the projected effect on complication rates, infection rates, patient experience, and total cost of care. The analysis shall be reviewed and approved by the Vascular Access Governance Committee and the Chief Nursing Officer before any staffing reduction is implemented.

### 4.2 Leadership and Governance Structure

4.2.1 The organization shall establish and maintain a Vascular Access Governance Committee (VAGC) as the primary interprofessional body responsible for the strategic direction, clinical standards, and quality oversight of all vascular access services.

4.2.2 **Committee Composition.** The VAGC shall include, at minimum: a Physician Champion (preferably with expertise in vascular access, interventional radiology, or critical care), the Vascular Access Specialist Team Lead or Manager, a Clinical Nurse Specialist or Nurse Educator with vascular access expertise, an Infection Preventionist, a Quality and Patient Safety representative, a Pharmacy representative, and a Supply Chain representative. Additional members may be appointed as needed.

4.2.3 **Key Responsibilities.** The VAGC shall be responsible for: establishing and maintaining clinical governance over all vascular access policies, procedures, and protocols; mentoring and developing vascular access clinical staff; leading and overseeing quality improvement initiatives; promoting evidence-based practice adoption; reviewing and approving changes to the vascular access product formulary; reviewing and acting upon complication surveillance data; and reporting to organizational leadership on program performance, risks, and resource needs.

4.2.4 **Operational Requirements.** The VAGC shall meet at minimum quarterly, maintain written meeting minutes, establish measurable annual goals with defined timelines, and report program performance to the appropriate hospital executive committee at minimum semi-annually.

### 4.3 Team Nomenclature and Professional Identity

4.3.1 The name of the vascular access service shall reflect the comprehensive, consultative nature of its work—encompassing device insertion, clinical assessment, patient education, quality oversight, and research. Acceptable designations include: Vascular Access Specialist Team (VAST), Vascular Access Resource Team, or Infusion Therapy Team.

4.3.2 The service name shall not imply a limited or task-focused scope (e.g., "IV Team" or "PICC Team") that fails to represent the breadth of clinical expertise and consultation services provided.

4.3.3 The organization shall establish and maintain a formal job description, position title, and career ladder for vascular access specialist roles that clearly define the qualifications, responsibilities, and advancement opportunities.

### 4.4 Financial Management and Sustainability

4.4.1 Vascular access services shall be integrated into the organization's formal annual budgetary process. The VAGC and the Vascular Access Service Manager shall prepare and submit an annual budget proposal that includes projected staffing costs, supply and equipment expenditures, education and certification costs, and capital requests.

4.4.2 **Revenue and Cost Center Designation.** In acute care settings, the vascular access service shall be designated as both a revenue center and a cost center. Revenue-generating activities (e.g., outpatient PICC placements, consultations) shall be tracked using appropriate billing codes. Cost-avoidance data (e.g., CABSI prevention, reduced emergency CVAD placements, reduced length of stay attributable to vascular access optimization) shall be quantified and reported as part of the annual financial review.

4.4.3 **Business Case Development.** The VAGC shall maintain a current business case document that demonstrates how revenue and cost-avoidance offset operational costs, providing a quantitative justification for the long-term sustainability of the dedicated specialist team. The business case shall be updated annually with current data and presented to organizational leadership.

4.4.4 The organization shall allocate sufficient funding for vascular access specialist professional development, including board certification preparation and maintenance, conference attendance, and continuing education, recognizing these as investments in quality and risk reduction.

### 4.5 Interprofessional Safety Collaborations

4.5.1 Vascular access specialists shall be formally integrated into the following institutional safety programs:

**Antimicrobial Stewardship Program.** Vascular access specialists shall participate in antimicrobial stewardship activities by ensuring that device selection and maintenance practices align with strategies to reduce antimicrobial resistance, including appropriate matching of device dwell time to prescribed therapy duration and consideration of infusate pH/osmolarity.

**Infection Prevention and Control.** Vascular access specialists shall collaborate with Infection Prevention to analyze device-associated infection data, implement and monitor CABSI prevention bundles, and develop device management strategies based on current epidemiological trends.

**Medication Safety Program.** Vascular access specialists shall participate in the review and analysis of IV-associated medication errors and systemic reactions (e.g., vancomycin flushing syndrome, extravasation injuries from vesicant medications), contributing to system-level solutions.

**Pain Management Program.** Vascular access specialists shall coordinate with acute pain service teams to ensure consistent delivery of Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA) and prevent lapses in analgesia related to vascular access device malfunction or displacement.

**Extravasation Prevention Program.** Vascular access specialists shall lead the development and maintenance of organizational extravasation prevention protocols, including risk assessment tools, antidote algorithms, and staff education programs for high-risk infusions.

**Infusion Pump Safety Program.** Vascular access specialists shall collaborate with Pharmacy and Biomedical Engineering on Dose Error Reduction System (DERS) committees to refine drug libraries, analyze override and alert data, and prevent programming errors.

### 4.6 Quality Improvement and Professional Development

4.6.1 The vascular access service shall utilize validated quality improvement frameworks—including Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), Lean Six Sigma, Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA), and Root Cause Analysis (RCA)—to systematically optimize workflows, reduce clinical risks, and improve outcomes.

4.6.2 The organization shall support vascular access team members in pursuing and maintaining board certifications (e.g., CRNI®, VA-BC™) and active membership in professional societies (e.g., AVA) to ensure the service remains aligned with the latest clinical evidence and professional standards.

## 5. Compliance

5.1 **Monitoring.** Compliance shall be monitored through annual review of the VAGC charter, meeting minutes, and goal attainment; annual financial review of the vascular access service budget versus actual expenditures and revenue; quarterly review of key clinical outcome metrics; and annual verification of board certification status for all vascular access specialist staff.

5.2 **Enforcement.** Failure to maintain the governance structures, financial reporting, or quality improvement activities required by this policy shall be reported to the Chief Nursing Officer and addressed through a corrective action plan with defined timelines.

## 6. Exceptions
