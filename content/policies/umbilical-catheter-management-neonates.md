# Umbilical Catheter Management in Neonates Policy

## 1. Policy Statement

It is the policy of this organization that umbilical arterial and venous catheters shall be placed and maintained in accordance with evidence-based standards that minimize infectious, thrombotic, and mechanical complications, that catheter tip position shall be verified by imaging prior to any therapeutic use, and that these devices shall be removed promptly when they no longer serve a clinical purpose.

## 2. Purpose

This policy exists to:

- Establish criteria for appropriate umbilical catheter use based on gestational age, birth weight, and clinical indication
- Define skin antisepsis requirements and agent-specific safety precautions for neonatal populations
- Specify optimal catheter tip positioning for both UAC and UVC
- Define imaging confirmation requirements prior to catheter use
- Establish securement standards and topical antimicrobial restrictions
- Define complication monitoring requirements
- Establish dwell time limits and removal technique standards

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to:

- All licensed clinical personnel inserting, managing, or removing umbilical catheters in neonatal patients
- Neonatal intensive care units and delivery settings within this organization where umbilical catheters are placed or managed
- All neonatal patients requiring umbilical arterial or venous catheterization, including premature neonates, very low birthweight infants, and term neonates
- All umbilical arterial catheters (UAC) and umbilical venous catheters (UVC)

## 4. Policy Requirements

### 4.1 Establishing Appropriate Use

4.1.1 Healthcare organizations shall develop internal protocols that define criteria for UAC and UVC placement, accounting for gestational age, birth weight, illness severity, and intended therapeutic interventions, to minimize unnecessary catheterization and associated complications.

#### 4.1.2 Indications by Catheter Type

4.1.2.1 **Umbilical Arterial Catheters (UAC)** are indicated when frequent arterial blood sampling is required or when continuous invasive blood pressure monitoring is clinically necessary.

4.1.2.2 **Umbilical Venous Catheters (UVC)** serve as a route for medication administration, intravenous solution delivery, parenteral nutrition, and blood product transfusion.

#### 4.1.3 Maintaining Catheter Patency

4.1.3.1 To preserve catheter function and reduce thrombotic risk, a continuous heparin infusion shall be administered. The recommended concentration ranges from 0.25 to 1.0 units per milliliter, with total daily heparin exposure maintained between 25 and 200 units per kilogram per day.

#### 4.1.4 Catheter Size Selection

4.1.4.1 The smallest gauge catheter capable of meeting clinical needs shall be selected, as smaller catheters are associated with reduced complication rates.

### 4.2 Skin Preparation and Antisepsis

4.2.1 Proper skin antisepsis shall be performed before catheter insertion.

#### 4.2.2 Acceptable Antiseptic Agents

4.2.2.1 Suitable antiseptic options include povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine in an alcohol-based formulation, and aqueous chlorhexidine solution. Current evidence does not establish clear superiority of any single antiseptic agent for neonatal safety or efficacy. Clinical judgment shall be applied in agent selection.

#### 4.2.3 Special Considerations for Vulnerable Populations

4.2.3.1 Both aqueous and alcohol-based chlorhexidine preparations shall be used with caution in preterm neonates, low birthweight infants, and any neonate within the first two weeks of life. These populations face elevated risk for chemical burns due to skin immaturity. While systemic absorption may occur through immature skin barriers, documented systemic effects have not been reported in the literature.

4.2.3.2 Tincture of iodine is contraindicated in premature neonates below 32 weeks gestational age due to potential adverse effects on thyroid function.

#### 4.2.4 Post-Procedure Antiseptic Removal

4.2.4.1 Following catheter placement, all antiseptic residue shall be removed from the skin using sterile water or sterile saline.

### 4.3 Optimal Catheter Tip Positioning

#### 4.3.1 Umbilical Arterial Catheter Placement

4.3.1.1 The UAC tip shall be positioned within the thoracic portion of the descending aorta, below the aortic arch. Two acceptable positions exist:

- **High position:** The catheter tip shall be between thoracic vertebrae 6 and 9. Evidence indicates this position carries lower complication rates compared to the low position.
- **Low position:** The tip shall be below the renal arteries but above the aortic bifurcation into the common iliac arteries, corresponding to the region between lumbar vertebrae 3 and 4.

#### 4.3.2 Umbilical Venous Catheter Placement

4.3.2.1 The UVC tip shall rest within the inferior vena cava at or slightly above the diaphragm, below the junction with the right atrium.

4.3.2.2 When a UVC is placed emergently with the tip in a non-central position, the catheter shall be replaced with more definitive vascular access as soon as clinical circumstances permit. Non-centrally positioned UVCs carry elevated risks for infection and other complications.

### 4.4 Estimating Insertion Length

4.4.1 Insertion depth shall be estimated using anatomical surface measurements, body weight-based equations, or other validated research-based protocols.

4.4.2 Clinicians shall recognize that all estimation methods demonstrate limited reliability. Regardless of the formula or technique employed, catheter tip position shall be confirmed through imaging before the catheter is used for any therapeutic purpose.

### 4.5 Radiographic and Imaging Confirmation

4.5.1 Catheter tip position shall be verified through radiography, echocardiography, or ultrasonography prior to clinical use.

#### 4.5.2 Imaging for Umbilical Venous Catheters

4.5.2.1 An anteroposterior radiographic view of the chest and abdomen shall be obtained to confirm UVC tip location at or slightly above the diaphragm. Using the cardiac silhouette as a reference point has been reported to yield greater accuracy than positioning based on vertebral body landmarks.

4.5.2.2 When the anteroposterior view fails to adequately identify the catheter pathway and tip location, additional imaging shall be obtained. Options include a lateral view, cross-table radiograph, or alternative modalities such as ultrasound.

4.5.2.3 Real-time ultrasound guidance during UVC insertion shall be considered as a strategy to reduce initial malposition rates.

4.5.2.4 Ultrasound imaging using parasternal long-axis and short-axis views for UVC tip localization demonstrates comparable accuracy to radiography. Injection of normal saline through the catheter during ultrasound examination may enhance visualization of the exact tip location.

4.5.2.5 Neonatal echocardiography shall be considered when superior accuracy is required, particularly in extremely low birthweight neonates or when identifying malpositioned catheters.

#### 4.5.3 Imaging for Umbilical Arterial Catheters

4.5.3.1 An anteroposterior radiographic view of the chest and abdomen shall be obtained to verify UAC tip location.

#### 4.5.4 Ongoing Position Surveillance

4.5.4.1 Regular surveillance of catheter tip position shall be performed throughout the period of catheterization. This surveillance is particularly important in low birthweight patients and those diagnosed with necrotizing enterocolitis.

### 4.6 Catheter Securement

4.6.1 Umbilical catheters shall be secured using sterile tape. Securement methods shall be selected based on their ability to maintain catheter position, preserve skin integrity, minimize complications including infection, and facilitate clinical management.

4.6.2 Organizational protocols shall address the elevated risk for catheter-associated skin injuries in this vulnerable population.

#### 4.6.3 Topical Antimicrobial Agents — Prohibition

4.6.3.1 Topical antibiotic ointments and creams shall not be applied to umbilical catheter sites. These agents increase the risk for fungal infections and contribute to the development of antimicrobial resistance.

### 4.7 Complication Monitoring

4.7.1 Clinical staff shall maintain vigilance for signs and symptoms of potential complications throughout the period of catheterization. Active monitoring shall include assessment for the following:

- **Vascular and hemorrhagic complications:** Bleeding from the umbilical stump, extravasation injury, and major hemorrhage
- **Embolic and thrombotic events:** Air embolism and catheter-related thrombosis
- **Infectious complications:** Local site infection and catheter-associated bloodstream infection
- **Cardiac complications:** Pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade, and cardiac arrhythmias
- **Organ-specific injury:** Hepatic damage from malpositioned UVCs
- **Perfusion abnormalities:** Peripheral vascular constriction and limb ischemia

4.7.2 Point-of-care ultrasound or echocardiography shall be considered for diagnostic evaluation when complications are suspected.

#### 4.7.3 Infection Prevention Bundle

4.7.3.1 Implementation of a standardized bundle of care shall be adopted to reduce the incidence of umbilical catheter-associated bloodstream infections.[^1][^2]

### 4.8 Catheter Removal Guidelines

#### 4.8.1 General Principle

4.8.1.1 Umbilical catheters shall be removed promptly when they no longer serve a clinical purpose or when any complication develops.

#### 4.8.2 Dwell Time Recommendations for Umbilical Venous Catheters

4.8.2.1 UVC dwell time shall be limited to 7 to 10 days. Infectious and thrombotic complications increase with prolonged catheterization.

4.8.2.2 As an infection prevention strategy, particularly for patients at elevated infection risk, consideration shall be given to UVC removal at 4 days with subsequent placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter for continued central venous access.

#### 4.8.3 Dwell Time Recommendations for Umbilical Arterial Catheters

4.8.3.1 UAC dwell time shall generally not exceed 5 days.

#### 4.8.4 Removal Technique

4.8.4.1 Umbilical catheters shall be removed slowly over several minutes. Prior to removal, an umbilical tie shall be placed around the stump.

4.8.4.2 For UAC removal specifically, the final 5 centimeters of catheter length shall be withdrawn slowly at a rate of approximately 1 centimeter per minute. This gradual removal allows adequate time for arterial vessel constriction to occur.

## 5. Compliance

### 5.1 Key Performance Indicators

- Rate of imaging confirmation of catheter tip position prior to first use (target: 100%)
- Rate of UAC dwell time compliance (≤5 days) (target: ≥95%)
- Rate of UVC dwell time compliance (≤7–10 days) (target: ≥95%)
- Umbilical catheter-associated bloodstream infection rate per 1,000 catheter-days
- Rate of topical antibiotic ointment use at umbilical catheter sites (target: 0%)
- Rate of post-procedure antiseptic removal documentation (target: ≥95%)
- Rate of infection prevention bundle adherence for umbilical catheters (target: ≥90%)

### 5.2 Enforcement

Non-compliance with this policy shall be addressed through the organization's standard performance improvement processes, including incident reporting, documentation review, targeted education, peer feedback, and escalation to neonatal intensive care leadership and the Vascular Access Governance Committee as appropriate.

## 6. Exceptions

Exceptions to standard dwell time limits or catheter use criteria may occur in emergency situations where removal is not immediately feasible or when a patient's clinical condition necessitates continued catheterization. Any exception shall be documented in the health record with clinical justification, and a plan for timely catheter removal or replacement shall be established. Exceptions shall be reviewed at the earliest opportunity and shall not become routine practice without formal policy revision.
