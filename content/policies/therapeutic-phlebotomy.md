# Therapeutic Phlebotomy

## **Overview**

Therapeutic phlebotomy is a medical procedure involving the controlled removal of blood to treat conditions characterized by excess red blood cells, iron overload, or other hematologic abnormalities. This guideline establishes standards and evidence-based recommendations for safe and effective therapeutic phlebotomy practice.

---

## **Core Standards**

### **Standard 1: Vascular Access Device Selection**

Selection of the most appropriate vascular access device for therapeutic phlebotomy should occur through shared decision-making involving the patient, caregiver when applicable, and the healthcare team. This collaborative approach must account for the projected treatment plan, anticipated duration of therapy, patient condition, and concurrent infusion requirements.

### **Standard 2: Risk Mitigation**

Healthcare providers must implement proactive interventions to reduce the risk of side effects and adverse reactions associated with therapeutic phlebotomy. This includes pre-procedural assessment, intraprocedural monitoring, and post-procedural care protocols tailored to individual patient needs.

### **Standard 3: Medical Waste Management**

All medical waste generated during therapeutic phlebotomy, including withdrawn blood, must be disposed of in strict accordance with institutional policies, applicable regulatory requirements, and established infection control guidelines.

---

## **Clinical Parameters and Indications**

### **Establishing Treatment Parameters**

Prior to initiating therapeutic phlebotomy, clinicians should establish clear treatment parameters that include laboratory values specific to the patient's diagnosis. Relevant values commonly include hemoglobin, hematocrit, and ferritin levels, though additional markers may be indicated based on the underlying condition (Barbui et al., 2018; Peedin & Karp, 2021; Katsarou et al., 2019).

The treatment protocol should specify threshold laboratory values that indicate when phlebotomy should be initiated and when it may be discontinued, the frequency of procedures, the type of vascular access device to be used, and the volume of blood to be withdrawn at each session. These parameters should be individualized based on diagnosis, disease severity, patient tolerance, and treatment goals (Fuqua et al., 2021; Lima et al., 2019; Kurtin & Lyle, 2018).

### **Alternative Approaches**

Erythrocytapheresis, an apheresis procedure in which red blood cells are selectively extracted while remaining blood components are returned to the patient, may serve as an alternative to traditional therapeutic phlebotomy. This approach is particularly valuable when rapid attainment of treatment goals is necessary to reduce blood viscosity and mitigate thrombotic risk, or when conventional phlebotomy fails to achieve therapeutic objectives. However, clinicians should be aware that apheresis carries higher rates of adverse reactions and significantly greater procedural costs compared to standard phlebotomy (Teofili et al., 2019).

## **Prevention and Management of Adverse Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

The most frequently encountered complications of therapeutic phlebotomy include hypovolemia, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, syncope, headache, fatigue, and hematoma formation at the access site (Kim & Oh, 2016; Van Buren et al., 2020).

### **Procedural Safeguards**

To minimize the risk of adverse events, the following measures should be implemented:

**Positioning:** Patients should be placed in a reclining chair or on an examination table or bed throughout the procedure. This positioning reduces the risk of injury in the event of syncope and facilitates venous access (Barbui et al., 2018; Fuqua et al., 2021).

**Vital Sign Monitoring:** Blood pressure, heart rate, and other relevant vital signs should be assessed before and after the procedure to detect hemodynamic instability promptly (Lima et al., 2019).

**Hydration:** Oral hydration should be encouraged both before and after the procedure. Oral hydration is preferred over parenteral fluid replacement in most circumstances. When parenteral fluid replacement is prescribed, the type of solution, volume, and infusion rate must be clearly specified (Shimura et al., 2019; Lim et al., 2020).

**Anxiety Assessment:** Patients should be asked about needle phobia or fear of blood prior to the procedure, as anxiety can exacerbate vasovagal responses and complicate the phlebotomy process.

**Post-Procedure Protocol:** Following completion of the procedure, patients should remain in a reclining position for several minutes before being assisted to rise slowly. This gradual transition helps prevent orthostatic hypotension and syncope (Kim & Oh, 2016).

---

## **Psychosocial Considerations**

### **Self-Harm Risk Assessment**

Clinicians must assess patients for a history of self-harm prior to initiating therapeutic phlebotomy. Evidence suggests that therapeutic phlebotomy may inadvertently become a substitute for usual self-harm practices in susceptible individuals. Furthermore, cessation of therapeutic phlebotomy in patients with this history may precipitate an increase in self-injurious behaviors. Appropriate mental health consultation and monitoring should be implemented when this risk is identified (Newham & Khanna, 2019).

---

## **Vascular Access Device Selection**

The choice of vascular access device should be guided by patient condition, anticipated treatment duration, and compatibility with other infusion therapies the patient may require.

### **Peripheral Intravenous Catheters**

Short peripheral intravenous catheters remain the most common choice for therapeutic phlebotomy. A 16- to 18-gauge device is recommended to facilitate adequate blood flow rates while minimizing hemolysis. The catheter should be inserted immediately before the procedure and removed upon completion (Peedin & Karp, 2021).

### **Central Vascular Access Devices**

When a central vascular access device, including an implanted vascular access port, is already in place, it may be utilized for therapeutic phlebotomy provided that doing so will not compromise other infusion therapies. Coordination with the patient's care team is essential to ensure that central line use for phlebotomy does not interfere with medication administration, parenteral nutrition, or other critical infusions (Hagle & Mikell, 2014).

---

## **Blood Collection Equipment**

Appropriate collection receptacles for therapeutic phlebotomy include collection bags designed for volunteer blood donation or bags specifically manufactured for therapeutic phlebotomy procedures. Syringes may also be utilized depending on the vascular access device in use.

**Critical Safety Warning:** Vacuum bottles must never be used to facilitate blood flow during therapeutic phlebotomy due to the significant risk of air embolism. Only collection systems designed for safe blood withdrawal should be employed.

---

## **Patient Education**

Comprehensive patient education is essential to ensure informed consent, promote adherence, and optimize outcomes. Education should address the following topics:

**Financial Considerations:** Patients should understand the anticipated costs of the procedure, including any charges not covered by insurance, frequency of treatments, and potential financial assistance resources.

**Quality of Life Impact:** Discussion should include how the treatment regimen may affect daily activities, work schedules, and lifestyle factors.

**Potential Side Effects:** Patients must be informed of common complications including hematoma at the puncture site, dizziness, fainting, headache, nausea, vomiting, and post-procedural fatigue (Van Buren et al., 2020).

**Treatment Adherence:** The consequences of missing scheduled treatments should be clearly explained, particularly for conditions where regular phlebotomy is essential for disease control.

**Activity Restrictions:** Any limitations on physical activity before and after the procedure should be communicated, including driving restrictions if applicable.

---

## **Combination Therapy**

Therapeutic phlebotomy may be employed as a sole treatment modality or in combination with pharmacologic or other therapeutic interventions to achieve optimal disease management. For example, in polycythemia vera, phlebotomy is frequently used alongside hydroxyurea or other cytoreductive agents (Podoltsev et al., 2018; Casu et al., 2021; Ginzburg et al., 2018).

The decision to combine therapies should be individualized based on disease characteristics, treatment response, patient tolerance, and evidence-based guidelines specific to the underlying condition.

---

## **Blood Utilization**

Emerging evidence suggests that blood collected during therapeutic phlebotomy from certain patient populations, particularly those with hereditary hemochromatosis, may be safe for use in blood transfusion. Studies have demonstrated comparable quality of red blood cell components and platelets from therapeutic donors compared to healthy volunteer donors (Mikaelsdottir et al., 2021; Sut et al., 2017).

Institutional policies and blood banking regulations should guide decisions regarding the disposition of blood collected during therapeutic phlebotomy, including potential eligibility for transfusion use.
