# Quality Improvement in Vascular Access Policy

## 1. Policy Statement

It is the policy of this organization that vascular access services shall be subject to a continuous, systematic quality improvement (QI) program that drives patient safety and clinical excellence through ongoing surveillance, data analysis, and proactive intervention. The QI program shall operate within a Just Culture framework that balances individual accountability with system-level improvement, utilizes validated improvement methodologies, and integrates medication safety and technology analytics into its surveillance activities.

## 2. Purpose

This policy exists to:

- Establish quality improvement as a mandatory, continuous, and interprofessional activity—not a static document or annual exercise—that is embedded in the daily operations of vascular access services.
- Require the maintenance of a Just Culture that encourages clinician reporting of errors, near-misses, and system vulnerabilities without fear of retribution, focusing on process improvement rather than individual blame.
- Mandate the adoption of validated QI methodologies (PDCA, Lean Six Sigma, RCA, HFMEA) for the systematic identification, analysis, and resolution of vascular access quality and safety issues.
- Define the requirements for audit and feedback mechanisms that translate surveillance data into actionable, real-time feedback for frontline clinicians.
- Establish the organization's surveillance and adverse event monitoring requirements for all vascular access devices.
- Integrate medication safety and infusion technology analytics into the vascular access QI program.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to:

- All members of the Vascular Access Governance Committee, the Vascular Access Specialist Team, the Quality and Patient Safety Department, Infection Prevention, Pharmacy, Clinical Education, and all other departments and individuals who contribute to vascular access quality and safety activities.
- All vascular access devices and infusion therapy activities within the organization.
- All clinical settings within the organization.
- All adverse events, near-misses, and quality indicators related to vascular access.

## 4. Policy Requirements

### 4.1 Just Culture Framework

4.1.1 The organization shall maintain a Just Culture for all vascular access quality and safety activities. Under this framework:
- **System Focus.** The primary focus of quality improvement shall be on identifying and correcting system-level failures, process deficiencies, and environmental factors that contribute to adverse events, rather than assigning individual blame for errors that arise from system vulnerabilities.
- **Error Reporting.** All clinicians shall be expected and encouraged to report vascular access errors, near-misses, and unsafe conditions through the organization's electronic safety reporting system without fear of punitive action. Reports shall be treated as confidential quality improvement data to the extent permitted by law.
- **Accountability Balance.** While the organization emphasizes system improvement, individual accountability is maintained for reckless behavior, willful violations of safety protocols, and impaired practice. The organization shall use a validated algorithm (e.g., the Just Culture Algorithm™) to distinguish between human error (console), at-risk behavior (coach), and reckless behavior (discipline).

4.1.2 **Non-Retaliation.** No clinician shall face adverse employment action, harassment, or professional retaliation for reporting a vascular access safety concern, error, or near-miss in good faith. Retaliation against a reporter is itself a policy violation subject to disciplinary action.

### 4.2 Quality Improvement Methodologies

4.2.1 The VAGC and Quality Department shall employ the following validated improvement frameworks as appropriate to the nature and scope of the quality issue:

**PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act).** The standard iterative four-step cycle for continuous process improvement. PDCA shall be the default methodology for routine improvement initiatives, including protocol revisions, workflow optimizations, and compliance improvement projects.

**Lean Six Sigma.** Applied for initiatives focused on eliminating waste and reducing variability in clinical workflows (e.g., standardizing the steps of a dressing change procedure, reducing turnaround time for VAST consultations, minimizing supply waste in insertion kits).

**Root Cause Analysis (RCA).** A mandatory, systematic, retrospective analysis conducted following any sentinel event, serious safety event, or cluster of adverse events related to vascular access. RCA shall identify the contributing factors at the individual, team, system, and environmental levels, and shall produce a corrective action plan with defined responsible parties and completion timelines.

**Healthcare Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (HFMEA).** A proactive, prospective analysis methodology used to identify where a vascular access process might fail before the failure occurs. HFMEA shall be conducted when: a new vascular access procedure is being introduced, a significant process change is being implemented, or a high-risk process is being redesigned.

4.2.2 **Methodology Selection.** The VAGC shall determine the appropriate methodology for each quality initiative based on the nature of the issue (reactive vs. proactive), the severity of the risk, and the scope of the process involved. The rationale for methodology selection shall be documented in the QI project charter.

### 4.3 Audit and Feedback Mechanisms

4.3.1 **Rationale-Driven Audits.** Every vascular access audit shall have a clearly defined purpose linked to a specific quality indicator or patient safety objective. Audits shall not be conducted without a documented "why" that connects the audit to a measurable outcome. For example, an audit of needleless connector disinfection compliance shall be directly linked to CABSI rate monitoring.

4.3.2 **Audit Types and Frequency.**
- **Concurrent observational audits** of vascular access insertion technique, site assessment, dressing changes, and hand hygiene shall be conducted by VAST members and Infection Prevention during clinical rounding, at minimum monthly.
- **Retrospective chart audits** of vascular access documentation completeness, line necessity reviews, and complication reporting shall be conducted by the Quality Department at minimum quarterly.
- **Focused audits** addressing specific identified concerns (e.g., a spike in phlebitis rates on a specific unit) shall be initiated within five (5) business days of the concern being identified and shall continue until the issue is resolved.

4.3.3 **Real-Time Feedback.** Audit findings shall not be held in reserve until a scheduled report. Findings must be translated into timely verbal and written feedback for frontline staff to guide immediate practice correction. The feedback loop shall include: individual coaching for the clinician observed (at the time of the observation when possible), unit-level aggregate data shared with the Charge Nurse and Unit Manager within one (1) week of the audit, and organizational aggregate data reported to the VAGC at each quarterly meeting.

4.3.4 **Standardized Definitions.** Data definitions, inclusion criteria, and measurement methods shall be standardized across all units and facilities within the organization to ensure valid "apples-to-apples" comparisons. The Quality Department shall maintain a Vascular Access Data Dictionary that defines each metric, its numerator, denominator, exclusion criteria, and data source.

### 4.4 Surveillance and Adverse Event Monitoring

4.4.1 The organization shall conduct aggressive, continuous surveillance of all vascular access devices. The following metrics shall be tracked, trended, and reported:

**Infection Rates.** Catheter-Associated Bloodstream Infection (CABSI) rates per 1,000 central line days, calculated and benchmarked using NHSN methodology and definitions. CABSI surveillance data shall be reviewed by Infection Prevention and the VAGC monthly.

**Premature Device Removal.** Analysis of all vascular access devices removed before the completion of prescribed therapy, including the reason for premature removal (complication, patient request, device malfunction, accidental dislodgment). Root causes of premature removal shall be analyzed quarterly to identify preventable causes.

**Unnecessary Placements.** Audits of CVAD utilization to ensure patients are not receiving invasive central lines when peripheral access would be clinically sufficient. The CVAD appropriateness rate shall be tracked and reported quarterly.

**Mechanical Complications.** Incidence rates for catheter occlusion, venous thromboembolism, infiltration, extravasation, phlebitis (graded by severity), catheter migration, catheter fracture or embolization, and pneumothorax.

4.4.2 **Surveillance Reporting.** The Quality Department shall produce a Vascular Access Quality Dashboard that is updated at minimum monthly and is accessible to all VAGC members, unit managers, and organizational leadership. The dashboard shall include trend data with statistical process control (SPC) charts to distinguish between common-cause and special-cause variation.

4.4.3 **Trigger Events.** The following events shall trigger an immediate investigation (within 48 hours): any CABSI event, any catheter-related death or serious harm, any cluster of two or more similar complications on the same unit within a defined period, and any event requiring external regulatory reporting.

### 4.5 Medication Safety and Technology Analytics

4.5.1 **Close Call (Near-Miss) Reporting.** The organization's safety reporting system shall be configured to capture vascular access-related "close calls"—incidents that were intercepted before reaching the patient. Close call data shall be analyzed with the same rigor as actual events, as they represent the organization's most valuable proactive safety intelligence.

4.5.2 **Smart Pump Analytics.** The VAGC and Pharmacy shall collaborate to regularly review data from smart infusion pumps, including: DERS alert and override rates by drug, unit, and clinician role; frequency and nature of programming errors; and patterns of "workaround" behavior that bypasses safety features (e.g., infusing outside of the drug library). Findings shall be reported to the Medication Safety Committee and used to refine drug library parameters and inform targeted staff education.

4.5.3 **Barcode Medication Administration (BCMA) Analytics.** The VAGC shall collaborate with Pharmacy and HIT to review BCMA compliance data for medications administered through vascular access devices. BCMA bypass rates and wrong-route scan events shall be tracked and addressed through system redesign and staff education.

4.5.4 **Technology-Driven Improvement.** The VAGC shall advocate for and support the implementation of clinical decision support (CDS) tools within the EHR that improve vascular access safety, including automated line necessity reminders, dressing change due alerts, and hard stops for high-risk infusion orders that require verification of appropriate access type.

## 5. Compliance

5.1 **Monitoring.** Compliance with this policy shall be monitored through review of the Vascular Access Quality Dashboard metrics and trends, tracking of RCA completion rates and corrective action implementation within defined timelines, audit and feedback cycle completion rates, safety event reporting volume (with the expectation that higher reporting volume indicates a healthier safety culture), and annual Just Culture assessment (staff survey measuring perception of reporting safety).

5.2 **Key Performance Indicators.**
- CABSI rate per 1,000 central line days (benchmarked against NHSN national data).
- Premature device removal rate with identified preventable cause rate.
- CVAD appropriateness rate.
- Safety event report volume (year-over-year trend).
- Close call reporting rate (target: year-over-year increase).
- RCA corrective action completion rate within defined timelines (target: 100%).
- Smart pump override rate (target: year-over-year reduction).

5.3 **Enforcement.** Failure to report a known adverse event or sentinel event is a serious policy violation. Failure of leadership to conduct a required RCA, implement corrective actions, or maintain surveillance reporting shall be escalated to the Chief Nursing Officer and Chief Medical Officer.

## 6. Exceptions

6.1 During periods of declared institutional emergency, surveillance and audit activities may be temporarily reduced to essential indicators only (CABSI, sentinel events). Full surveillance shall be restored within thirty (30) days of the emergency resolution.

6.2 No exception shall be granted for the Just Culture non-retaliation provisions or the mandatory reporting of sentinel events.
