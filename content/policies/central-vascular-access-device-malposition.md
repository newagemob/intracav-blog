# Clinical Guideline: Central Vascular Access Device Malposition

## **Assessment, Prevention, and Management**

**Version:** 1.0
**Effective Date:** January 2026
**Review Date:** January 2028

---

## **1. Purpose and Scope**

This guideline establishes evidence-based recommendations for clinicians responsible for assessing, preventing, and managing malposition of central vascular access devices (CVADs). The standard applies to all healthcare professionals involved in CVAD insertion, maintenance, and monitoring across acute care, ambulatory, and home infusion settings.

**Clinical Standard:** Clinicians must assess for CVAD malposition and employ appropriate resources and interventions when malposition is suspected or confirmed. Early recognition and prompt management are essential to prevent serious complications including vessel erosion, cardiac dysrhythmias, infiltration, and life-threatening events such as cardiac tamponade.

---

## **2. Definitions and Classification**

### **2.1 Primary Malposition**

Primary malposition occurs during or immediately following the CVAD insertion procedure. The catheter tip becomes positioned in an anatomically aberrant location rather than the intended target (typically the lower third of the superior vena cava at the cavoatrial junction).

### **2.2 Secondary Malposition**

Secondary malposition, also referred to as tip migration, develops at any point during the catheter dwell time after initial correct placement has been confirmed. This phenomenon results from changes in patient condition, physiological pressures, or mechanical factors affecting catheter position.

---

## **3. Anatomical Considerations and Malposition Sites**

Understanding normal vascular anatomy and acceptable CVAD tip locations is essential for recognizing aberrant catheter positioning. Clinicians must correlate expected anatomy with potential malposition sites in the thorax, abdomen, and neck.

### **3.1 Intravascular Malposition Sites**

**Upper Body Insertions:** Primary intravascular malposition from jugular, subclavian, or upper extremity insertion sites may result in catheter positioning within the aorta, lower right atrium, right ventricle, ipsilateral or contralateral brachiocephalic (innominate) veins, subclavian veins, internal jugular veins, azygous vein, internal mammary vein, and various smaller tributary vessels (Raptis et al., 2020; Wortley & Almerol, 2020; Struck et al., 2018).

**Femoral Insertions:** Lower extremity access may produce malposition in the lumbar veins, iliolumbar veins, and common iliac veins (Büttner et al., 2017).

### **3.2 Extravascular Malposition Sites**

When catheters migrate outside the vascular system, they may cause serious complications depending on location. Extravascular malposition includes catheter positioning within the mediastinum (causing infiltration or extravasation), thoracic duct (producing chylothorax), pleural space (resulting in hemothorax or pleural effusion), pericardium (leading to pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade, particularly concerning in infants), peritoneum (causing intra-abdominal bleeding and potential abdominal compartment syndrome), and adjacent structures through fistula formation including tracheal communication (Sertic et al., 2018; Blackwood et al., 2016; Zarkesh & Haghjoo, 2022). In neonates, malposition into the epidural space has also been documented (Chin et al., 2021).

---

## **4. Etiology of Malposition**

### **4.1 Causes of Primary Malposition**

Multiple factors contribute to primary malposition during insertion. Inadequate catheter length selection or insufficient insertion depth frequently results in suboptimal tip positioning. Patient positioning changes from supine to upright during or after insertion alter the relationship between anatomical landmarks and actual tip location. Respiratory movement, particularly diaphragmatic excursion, affects catheter position, with mechanical ventilation creating additional variability. Upper extremity and shoulder positioning influence catheter trajectory, while body habitus factors including obesity and breast tissue affect measurement accuracy and insertion angles (Raptis et al., 2020; Hade et al., 2019).

Congenital venous abnormalities represent an important and often unrecognized cause of malposition. Persistent left superior vena cava and variations in inferior vena cava anatomy, azygous vein configuration, and pulmonary venous return may not be diagnosed until CVAD insertion is attempted. These anatomical variants can make achieving appropriate tip position challenging or impossible through standard techniques (Oye et al., 2020).

Acquired venous changes including thrombosis, stenosis, and malignant or benign lesions may prevent catheter advancement to the appropriate position. Prior trauma can also alter venous anatomy and create obstacles to optimal catheter placement (Raptis et al., 2020; Koyuncu et al., 2020).

### **4.2 Causes of Secondary Malposition**

Tip migration during dwell time results from several mechanisms. Sporadic changes in intrathoracic pressure from coughing, vomiting, or straining can displace the catheter tip. CVADs with tips originally positioned high in the superior vena cava are more susceptible to migration. Development of deep vein thrombosis may alter flow dynamics and push the catheter into aberrant positions. Congestive heart failure changes cardiac dimensions and vascular pressures, potentially affecting catheter position. Neck and arm movement, particularly in active patients, creates repetitive mechanical stress on the catheter. Positive pressure ventilation, vigorous exercise, and partial or complete dislodgement from the insertion site all contribute to secondary malposition (Wang et al., 2018; Hignell & Phelps, 2020).

---

## **5. Prevention Strategies**

### **5.1 Insertion Site Selection**

The side of insertion influences malposition risk. Left-sided insertions carry higher malposition risk due to the longer course of the left brachiocephalic vein and the more diagonal pathway to the heart. Additionally, left-sided catheters are more prone to contact the contralateral wall of the superior vena cava, increasing the risk of vessel erosion (Dornbos et al., 2019).

### **5.2 Insertion Technique Optimization**

Bevel orientation during guidewire insertion may reduce malposition incidence. For internal jugular venous access, orienting the bevel medially facilitates guidewire advancement toward the appropriate target. For subclavian approaches, caudal bevel orientation promotes proper catheter trajectory (Dornbos et al., 2019; Craigie et al., 2018).

### **5.3 Real-Time Imaging During Insertion**

Ultrasound visualization during insertion reduces the risk of inadvertent arterial cannulation. Additionally, ultrasound can identify cephalad tip orientation in the jugular vein before removing the sterile field, allowing immediate correction. Multiple studies support routine ultrasound use for CVAD placement (De Cassai et al., 2021; Kozyak et al., 2022; Aurshina et al., 2019; Ablordeppey et al., 2022; Keyal et al., 2020).

Tip location technology enhances detection of primary malposition during insertion. Electrocardiogram-guided placement, intracavitary electrocardiography, and other navigation technologies provide real-time feedback on catheter position, allowing adjustments before procedure completion (Alexandrou et al., 2022; Chai et al., 2022).

### **5.4 Avoiding High-Risk Tip Positions**

Catheter tips positioned in the lower right atrium are associated with increased risk of infective endocarditis. This occurs due to mechanical abrasion of the tricuspid valve or cardiac wall by the catheter tip, creating an entry point for microorganisms into the bloodstream (Chen et al., 2020).

---

## **6. Clinical Assessment and Recognition**

### **6.1 Signs and Symptoms of Malposition**

Assessment for malposition should occur before each CVAD infusion, as clinical findings are often the first indication of catheter migration. Clinicians should evaluate for absence of blood return from any catheter lumen (though this finding alone is not diagnostic); changes in blood color or pulsatility of the blood return; difficulty or inability to flush the catheter; arterial waveform patterns when connected to a pressure transducer; new atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias; changes in blood pressure or heart rate; shoulder, chest, or back pain developing during insertion or dwell time; edema in the neck or shoulder region; respiratory changes; patient complaints of hearing gurgling or flow sounds on the ipsilateral side; and paresthesia or neurological effects that may indicate retrograde infusion into intracranial venous sinuses (Chen et al., 2019; Mauri et al., 2018; Pereira et al., 2016).

### **6.2 Monitoring for Dislodgement**

CVAD dislodgement represents a common cause of secondary malposition. Clinicians should measure and document the external catheter length at each dressing change and compare this measurement to the length documented at insertion. Discrepancies indicate potential dislodgement and tip migration (Chen et al., 2018).

Dislodgement occurs through multiple mechanisms including arm movement, body habitus changes, patient manipulation of the catheter (sometimes termed Twiddler's syndrome), inadequate securement, and improper dressing or securement device removal.

**Critical Safety Point:** Never advance any external portion of a CVAD that has contacted skin back into the insertion site. No antiseptic agent or technique can render skin or the external catheter sterile. No evidence supports any safe time interval after insertion for such manipulation. Management of significant dislodgement typically requires catheter exchange over a guidewire or removal with insertion at a new site.

### **6.3 Pediatric Considerations**

Growth in infants and children with indwelling CVADs can produce suboptimal tip location over time. Clinicians should monitor growth parameters and correlate them with anticipated changes in catheter tip position. Planning for scheduled CVAD exchanges should account for growth-related tip migration (Sertic et al., 2018; Chin et al., 2021).

---

## **7. Diagnostic Evaluation**

### **7.1 Imaging Modalities**

When malposition is suspected based on clinical assessment or catheter dysfunction, diagnostic imaging should be obtained. Available modalities include chest radiography (with or without contrast injection), fluoroscopy, echocardiography, computed tomography (CT) scanning, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Selection depends on clinical presentation, available resources, and specific diagnostic questions (Raptis et al., 2020; Cunningham et al., 2020).

Communication with radiology personnel should include relevant clinical information to enhance their ability to identify the problem. Organizations should establish protocols with radiology departments to ensure routine imaging studies include assessment of catheter tip location when CVADs are present, along with clear reporting pathways for malpositioned catheters discovered incidentally.

### **7.2 Limitations of Routine Radiography**

Routine chest radiographs at scheduled intervals may fail to detect tip migration due to the sporadic and unpredictable nature of catheter movement. Each healthcare facility should evaluate the utility of admission chest radiographs for patients with existing CVADs based on patient population and clinical context.

### **7.3 Confirming Arterial Versus Venous Placement**

If inadvertent arterial placement is suspected (suggested by stroke or neurological injury, hematoma, or hemothorax at insertion or during dwell), definitive confirmation requires pressure transducer waveform analysis, blood gas values from the catheter, or computed tomography angiography (CTA). Visual assessment of blood pulsatility and color are unreliable indicators, particularly in hypotensive patients or when sampling through lengthy catheters (Ge et al., 2015; Dornbos et al., 2019).

---

## **8. Management Approaches**

### **8.1 General Principles**

Management decisions depend on the malposition location, ongoing infusion therapy requirements, and patient acuity. Consultation with the primary provider and interventional radiology should occur as indicated.

**Critical Action:** Withhold infusion through a malpositioned catheter until appropriate tip position has been established. If continued therapy is required, assess the prescribed regimen for peripheral compatibility and consider inserting a short peripheral intravenous catheter. When infusion therapy cannot be delivered peripherally, evaluate the risk of temporary discontinuation and consult with the ordering provider regarding alternative regimens while working to reestablish appropriate CVAD tip location (Gorski, 2023).

### **8.2 Noninvasive Repositioning Techniques**

Noninvasive or minimally invasive approaches are preferred as initial interventions. Bedside ultrasound can identify catheter malposition in the internal jugular vein and guide repositioning attempts (Spencer, 2017; Zaghloul et al., 2019; Song et al., 2018).

**High-Flow Flush Technique:** For catheters angling cephalad into the internal jugular vein, contralateral subclavian or brachiocephalic vein, or other tributary vessels, a repositioning protocol involves elevating the patient's head to 60° to 90° (high Fowler's position) and performing a forceful flush through the catheter. Instructing the patient to cough during flushing may alter intrathoracic pressures sufficiently to allow catheter movement. Repeat imaging should confirm tip location following any repositioning attempt (Spencer, 2017; Gautam et al., 2015; Mesa et al., 2021).

**Intracardiac Malposition:** When the catheter tip is positioned in the lower two thirds of the right atrium or the right ventricle, the catheter should be retracted. Retraction distance should be determined using electrocardiogram guidance or direct measurement from chest radiography (Gorski, 2023).

### **8.3 Invasive Repositioning Techniques**

When noninvasive methods fail, invasive techniques include catheter exchange over a guidewire and interventional radiology procedures performed under fluoroscopic guidance. For long-term CVADs, repositioning may require inserting a diagnostic catheter via the femoral vein under fluoroscopy and using snaring techniques to manipulate the malpositioned tip (Gautam et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2018).

### **8.4 Management of Arterial Placement**

**Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters:** For a PICC inadvertently placed in an artery, remove the catheter and apply direct manual pressure to the arterial puncture site until hemostasis is achieved. Notify the primary clinical team for ongoing observation (Gorski, 2023).

**Large-Bore Central Catheters:** For inadvertent arterial placement from axillo-subclavian or jugular insertion sites, simple removal with manual compression creates significant risk. Withdrawal of large catheters from accessed arteries (particularly the carotid) with site compression increases risk of brain ischemia from interrupted blood flow, hematoma formation, or embolization. Consultation with interventional radiology and vascular surgery is essential to develop an appropriate removal plan. Endovascular techniques or open surgical repair may be required. Delay in management increases thrombosis risk (Dornbos et al., 2019; Ge et al., 2015).

### **8.5 Neonatal Considerations**

Repositioning approaches in neonates differ from adult techniques. Noninvasive attempts include elevating the head of the bed for internal jugular malposition, positioning the infant on the opposite side with head elevated for brachiocephalic malposition, and gentle flushing or fluid infusion. Secondary intravascular malposition in neonates may respond to extremity repositioning including abduction, adduction, flexion, or extension of the affected limb (Zaghloul et al., 2019; Sharpe et al., 2022).

### **8.6 Special Circumstances**

**Cardiac Tamponade:** If tamponade is suspected, fluid aspiration from the CVAD before removal may be indicated. Immediate consultation with cardiology and critical care teams is essential (Gorski, 2023; Zarkesh & Haghjoo, 2022).

**Infiltration or Extravasation:** When extravascular catheter migration has caused infiltration or extravasation, removal must be coordinated with appropriate treatment for the specific medication involved based on established extravasation protocols (Wang et al., 2018; Spencer, 2017; Gautam et al., 2015).

---

## **9. Power Injection Considerations**

Only CVADs specifically labeled for power injection should be used with contrast media injection devices. Power injection through malpositioned catheters has been reported to cause mediastinal extravasation, and the force of injection may itself cause catheter migration.

Before and after power injection, clinicians should assess for clinical signs and symptoms of malposition, verify catheter patency by manual flush, aspirate for blood return, and confirm correct tip location. When uncertainty exists regarding tip position or catheter patency, a scout scan or topogram should be performed before power injection (Wortley & Almerol, 2020; American College of Radiology, 2023).

## **10. Quality and Safety Measures**

### **10.1 Documentation Requirements**

Complete documentation should include initial catheter length at insertion, tip location confirmation method and results, external catheter length measurements at each assessment, clinical findings suggesting malposition, diagnostic imaging results, repositioning attempts and outcomes, and consultation records.

### **10.2 Organizational Policy Development**

Healthcare organizations should establish policies addressing routine imaging requirements for patients with CVADs on admission; radiology department protocols for reporting incidentally discovered malposition; communication pathways between clinical staff and radiology; competency requirements for CVAD insertion and assessment; and equipment availability for tip location confirmation during insertion.
