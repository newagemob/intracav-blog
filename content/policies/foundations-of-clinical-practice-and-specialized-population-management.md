description = "This comprehensive guide outlines evidence-based principles of vascular access and infusion therapy across the lifespan, including neonatal, pediatric, obstetric, and geriatric populations. It covers regulatory compliance, ethical practice, device selection, infusion accuracy, and population-specific risks such as DEHP exposure, DIVA management, pregnancy-related hypercoagulability, and geriatric polypharmacy. Designed for clinicians, nurses, and vascular access specialists, this resource supports safe, patient-centered decision-making aligned with current standards of care."

# 1. Core Principles of Vascular Care

The administration of infusion therapy and the management of vascular access devices (VADs) must be governed by a structured hierarchy of safety and ethics. These principles apply to all access types, including peripheral, central, intraosseous, subcutaneous, and epidural/intrathecal routes.

- **Regulatory Alignment:** Clinicians must adhere to the specific legislative and regulatory framework of their jurisdiction (national, state, or provincial).
- **Organizational Standards:** Every clinical action must be traceable to formal institutional policies, standardized protocols, or written orders.
- **Ethical Advocacy:** Practitioners are the primary defenders of patient autonomy and dignity. Decisions should prioritize safety over efficiency and remain free from commercial influence or conflicts of interest.

# 2. Pediatric and Neonatal Considerations

Pediatric vascular access requires a departure from adult “one-size-fits-all” approaches due to unique physiological and developmental requirements.

## Physiological Precision

- **DEHP Exposure:** Equipment, particularly administration sets, should be free of Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) to minimize plasticizer-related risks in neonates and children.
- **Volume Accuracy:** Infusion pumps must be capable of delivering precise, low-volume rates. Calculations should be strictly based on age, weight, or body surface area.
- **Dermatologic Fragility:** In preterm infants, the skin barrier is underdeveloped, increasing the risk of systemic absorption of antiseptics and mechanical injury. Vigilant monitoring for chemical burns and systemic toxicity is mandatory.

## Technical Enhancements

- **DIVA Protocols:** For patients with Difficult Intravenous Access (DIVA), ultrasound-guided insertion or near-infrared visualization should be standard practice.
- **Non-Traditional Sites:** If standard peripheral sites are exhausted, advanced techniques such as the supraclavicular approach to the brachiocephalic vein or tunneled femoral cannulation may be indicated.
- **Pain Management:** Non-pharmacologic comfort measures are essential to mitigate long-term needle phobia and medical trauma.

# 3. Obstetric Considerations

Pregnancy alters maternal hemodynamics and pharmacokinetics, necessitating a dual focus on both maternal and fetal safety.

- **PICC Risks:** Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters (PICCs) in pregnant patients are associated with higher rates of thrombosis and infection due to the natural hypercoagulable state of pregnancy.
- **Labor Management:** For low-risk patients, *indication-only* peripheral IV insertion is preferred over routine placement, provided the facility has resources for rapid emergency response.
- **Nutritional Support:** In cases of Hyperemesis Gravidarum, enteral feeding (nasogastric or nasoduodenal) is the first-line intervention. Parenteral nutrition (PN) should be reserved for cases where enteral methods have failed.

---

# 4. Geriatric Considerations

Aging introduces structural changes in the vasculature, including thinning of dermal layers and thickening of the tunica intima, leading to increased vessel fragility.

- **Cognitive and Functional Assessment:** Prior to authorizing home-based infusion therapy, clinicians must evaluate manual dexterity, cognitive status, and the patient’s ability to identify complications.
- **Polypharmacy:** Older adults are at high risk for drug–drug interactions. Frequent medication reconciliation is a critical safety component of vascular therapy.
- **Dialysis Access:** While arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are generally preferred, dialysis access decisions should be individualized, balancing life expectancy and frailty against the risks of central vascular access devices (CVADs).
