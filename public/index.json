[{"content":"Clinical Guidelines Are Rotting: The Case for API-First Medical Knowledge \u0026ldquo;All the projects I\u0026rsquo;ve had to make, I\u0026rsquo;ve made because I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find anything better. I much prefer other people solving my problems. Me having to come up with a project is actually a failure on the world.\u0026rdquo; - Linus Torvalds\nThe Problem: PDFs Aren\u0026rsquo;t Healthcare APIs Every day, thousands of clinicians make life-altering decisions based on clinical guidelines that exist primarily as static PDF documents or basic web pages. The American College of Cardiology publishes heart failure guidelines as downloadable documents. The Infectious Diseases Society of America distributes antimicrobial recommendations through their website. And countless hospital systems maintain internal protocols as Word documents on SharePoint sites.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t just an aesthetic issue—it\u0026rsquo;s an interoperability crisis.\nWhen guidelines exist only as human-readable documents, they can\u0026rsquo;t be directly integrated into the systems where decisions actually happen. They become reference materials that require manual interpretation and implementation, creating endless opportunities for inconsistency, delay, and error.\nLet me be clear: the clinical expertise behind these guidelines is extraordinary. The problem isn\u0026rsquo;t the knowledge itself—it\u0026rsquo;s how we package and distribute it.\nThe Consequence: A Fragmented Knowledge Ecosystem The consequences of this document-centric approach ripple throughout healthcare:\nGuidelines become stale on arrival. The average clinical guideline takes 17 months to develop and publish. By the time it reaches clinicians, new evidence may already challenge its recommendations. When updates require complete republication, the cycle perpetuates.\nImplementation becomes a secondary translation project. Each healthcare system must independently interpret guidelines and encode them into order sets, alerts, and documentation templates—duplicating effort across thousands of organizations and introducing inconsistencies in how the same evidence is applied.\nKnowledge becomes fragmented across specialties. A patient with diabetes, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease is subject to guidelines from three different specialty societies, each with its own publication cycle, terminology, and emphasis. The burden of reconciling these falls on busy clinicians at the point of care.\nOrganizations struggle with sustainability. Guideline developers face a fundamental business challenge: their traditional publication models are increasingly at odds with digital healthcare\u0026rsquo;s need for programmatic access to knowledge.\nThe Vision: Guidelines as Infrastructure Imagine instead if clinical guidelines were built like modern software APIs—programmatically accessible, versioned, and designed for integration:\nA hospital\u0026rsquo;s Electronic Health Record could make a simple call like:\nGET /diabetes/a1c-targets/v2023.4?patient_age=67\u0026amp;renal_function=reduced And receive a structured response:\n{ \u0026#34;target_range\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;lower\u0026#34;: 7.0, \u0026#34;upper\u0026#34;: 8.0, \u0026#34;unit\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;percent\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;evidence_level\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;rationale\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Moderate glycemic control is appropriate given age and renal status\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;references\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;pmid:34128996\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;relevance\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;primary\u0026#34; } ], \u0026#34;last_updated\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2025-04-15\u0026#34; } This isn\u0026rsquo;t science fiction. The financial industry transformed itself through APIs like Stripe and Plaid that make complex operations accessible through simple, standardized interfaces. Climate scientists share models through programmatic interfaces. Even government regulations are increasingly available as machine-readable data.\nYet in healthcare—where precision and timeliness literally save lives—we\u0026rsquo;re stuck with PDFs, Word documents, and manually coded order sets.\nThe Architecture: Certified Open Source for Healthcare Knowledge Traditional open source models won\u0026rsquo;t work for clinical knowledge—healthcare requires higher standards for verification, evidence, and governance. What we need is certified open source: a model that combines rigorous clinical oversight with the technical infrastructure of modern collaborative development.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what this would look like:\nVersion-controlled knowledge repositories where guidelines are maintained not as documents but as structured data with complete audit trails. Each recommendation would carry metadata about its evidence basis, approval chain, and relationship to other knowledge.\nFormal governance processes that verify contributor credentials and maintain appropriate specialty oversight. Unlike traditional open source where anyone can contribute, healthcare repositories would implement verification systems ensuring contributors have relevant clinical expertise.\nMachine-readable formats designed for implementation, not just reading. Guidelines would be published simultaneously as human-readable documents and as API endpoints with standardized schemas.\nImplementation toolkits that help systems consume and apply guidelines consistently. Instead of each organization independently translating guidelines into EHR configurations, they could leverage reference implementations.\nContinuous update mechanisms that allow incremental revisions as new evidence emerges. Rather than waiting for complete guideline rewrites every five years, specific recommendations could be updated as soon as supporting evidence changes.\nReal-World Examples: This Is Already Starting This isn\u0026rsquo;t purely theoretical. Components of this vision already exist:\nHL7\u0026rsquo;s FHIR Clinical Practice Guidelines implementation guide provides standardized formats for expressing guidelines in machine-readable form. Though early in adoption, it demonstrates the technical feasibility.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic forced rapid, distributed knowledge development. The NIH\u0026rsquo;s COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines evolved through continuous updates rather than periodic republication, showing the value of incremental knowledge refinement.\nThe OpenEHR Foundation has demonstrated how clinical archetypes can be collaboratively developed and maintained while preserving rigorous clinical governance.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s missing isn\u0026rsquo;t the technical capability—it\u0026rsquo;s the organizational transformation and standards adoption to make this approach mainstream.\nThe Barriers: Why We\u0026rsquo;re Stuck If this approach is so promising, why hasn\u0026rsquo;t it happened? Several barriers stand in our way:\nBusiness model challenges. Organizations whose revenue depends on publishing guidelines face difficult transitions to service-oriented models focused on implementation support rather than content access.\nTechnical infrastructure gaps. Building robust API-driven knowledge systems requires significant investment and expertise that many medical societies lack.\nGovernance concerns. Clinical leaders rightfully worry about quality control in more open systems, requiring thoughtful governance frameworks that maintain appropriate oversight.\nCultural resistance. Both guideline developers and healthcare systems are accustomed to document-centric workflows, making change management as important as technical transformation.\nStandards fragmentation. Despite promising work from HL7 and others, we lack universal standards for encoding clinical knowledge as APIs.\nA Path Forward: What We Must Do If we\u0026rsquo;re serious about transforming clinical knowledge from static documents to living infrastructure, we need action across the healthcare ecosystem:\nFor guideline organizations: Start developing API-first publishing pipelines alongside traditional documents. Explore service-oriented business models focused on implementation support, certification programs, and integration tools rather than document access alone.\nFor EHR vendors: Build standardized interfaces for consuming structured guidelines from trusted sources. Move beyond proprietary knowledge management toward open standards that enable knowledge sharing across systems.\nFor healthcare systems: Demand machine-readable guidelines from specialty organizations. Prioritize vendors who support automated knowledge integration. Build technical capabilities to consume and implement guideline APIs.\nFor standards bodies: Accelerate development of universal formats for guideline representation. Create certification mechanisms that preserve clinical governance while enabling programmatic access.\nFor developers: Build reference implementations and open-source tools that demonstrate the power of API-driven clinical knowledge. Create bridges between existing guidelines and modern integration patterns.\nBeyond Documents: Clinical Knowledge as Living Infrastructure We must stop thinking of guidelines as documents to be read and start viewing them as infrastructure to be implemented. This isn\u0026rsquo;t about diminishing clinical expertise—it\u0026rsquo;s about amplifying it through better distribution channels.\nThe organizations that embrace this transformation won\u0026rsquo;t be threatened by openness—they\u0026rsquo;ll be defined by their ability to make their expertise more accessible, implementable, and impactful than ever before.\nMedical knowledge is too important to be trapped in PDFs. It\u0026rsquo;s time we treat clinical guidelines with the same engineering rigor we apply to the systems that deliver medications, process lab results, and monitor vital signs. Our patients deserve nothing less.\nThis post represents my perspectives as a developer working with healthcare systems. I welcome discussion and feedback, particularly from clinicians and guideline developers, as we collectively work to improve healthcare knowledge distribution and implementation.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/apis-over-guidelines/","summary":"Why healthcare must move beyond PDF guidelines to API-first medical knowledge: exploring the interoperability crisis and the case for machine-readable clinical protocols.","title":"APIs Over Guidelines"},{"content":"IntracavOS: The Beautiful Paranoia of Total Control By the time we finished the first pot of coffee, it was clear the world had gone soft—soggy even—sloshing data through bloated, faceless servers humming somewhere in Oregon or Virginia. Call it the convenience of APIs. Call it the outsourcing of trust. Call it what it is: a ticking bomb with a cheery user interface. When you’re dealing with healthcare—when you’re swimming in HIPAA compliance and patient data—the stakes aren’t just regulatory. They’re existential. And that’s why IntracavOS exists.\nIntracavOS isn’t a product; it’s a statement. A declaration that the easy path is often the weakest one. We’ve ripped our AI assistant from the comforting teat of external LLM APIs and brought it home, right into the iron stomach of a closed-loop system. The migration wasn’t about convenience or cost (though it saved plenty). It was about control—unwavering, bloodshot, paranoid control.\nThe Safety of Isolation To understand the logic, you first need to accept the premise: there is no security in a network. Not truly. Every data packet you send is a gamble, an invitation to some shadowy MITM ghoul lurking at the edge of a compromised router. Sure, you encrypt it. Sure, you trust the third-party API. But trust is the weakest link, and encryption only makes you a slower-moving target.\nIntracavOS, on the other hand, doesn’t send packets. It doesn’t trust. It operates entirely within its own borders. Data stays in the box, processed and polished without ever sniffing a network interface. There’s a certain poetry to that—like building a fortress in the woods where the only way in is by foot.\nIsolation isn’t just secure; it’s liberating. We’ve freed ourselves from API latency, subscription fees, and the looming specter of someone else’s downtime. Every bit of compute power is ours. Every failure is ours. And that’s the trade: absolute responsibility for absolute control.\nEmbracing the Drawbacks Critics will say this setup is claustrophobic, that we’ve painted ourselves into a corner of self-reliance. They’re right. But they’re also cowards. Here’s the thing: what they call a \u0026ldquo;drawback,\u0026rdquo; we call a feature.\nNo Cloud, No Scalability? Good.\nThere’s no faceless cloud to scale into infinity, no sprawling infrastructure spinning up nodes in Singapore or Iowa. That’s a feature. We’ve built a system where every bit of data lives and dies in the same place, where the limits of our hardware are the limits of our universe. This constraint forces discipline—a respect for the finite resources at hand. And discipline breeds security.\nNo Monitoring Services? Fine.\nWhen you rely on someone else to monitor your system, you’ve already given up the game. Their logs, their alerts, their definitions of \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo;—all just another form of trust. With IntracavOS, the monitoring is ours. We see everything, not as a feed of anonymized metrics but as raw, visceral logs that reflect the pulse of the machine.\nA Single Point of Failure? Exactly.\nThe critics call this a vulnerability, as if scattering your secrets across 12 cloud regions makes you safer. It doesn’t. It just makes the failure more complex and less predictable. With a closed-loop system, the failure point is singular and knowable. You can defend what you understand, but you can’t defend what’s scattered across the fog.\nParanoia as a Philosophy The beauty of IntracavOS isn’t just in its functionality; it’s in its paranoia. Every design choice assumes the worst. Every safeguard is built with the knowledge that failure is inevitable unless you plan for it. This isn’t pessimism—it’s survivalism.\nWe encrypt at rest because we don’t trust our own hardware.\nWe isolate processes because we don’t trust our own code.\nWe audit every component because we don’t trust ourselves to remember why it was installed in the first place.\nThis level of control isn’t for everyone. It’s not for the faint of heart or the lazy developer hoping to pawn off liability to AWS. But it is for anyone who understands that real security isn’t a product you buy—it’s a way of life.\nThe Reckoning When you look at IntracavOS, you might see a machine: fast, precise, hermetically sealed. But if you look closer, you’ll see a mirror. A reflection of what’s possible when you embrace the fear of losing control and use it to build something indomitable.\nIt’s not a perfect system—because perfection is a lie we tell ourselves to avoid discomfort. It’s just a secure one, and that’s better than perfection. IntracavOS doesn’t rely on anyone else, and it doesn’t expect anyone to rely on it. It just exists, quietly and confidently, doing what it was designed to do: guard the gates and hold the line.\nIf you want something softer, something easier, you know where to find it. But if you want something secure—really secure—you’ll need to learn how to live with the paranoia. It’s not so bad once you get used to it.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/intracavos-beautiful-paranoia-total-control/","summary":"The case for total control in healthcare AI: how IntracavOS achieves absolute security through complete isolation, eliminating external dependencies and API vulnerabilities.","title":"IntracavOS: The Beautiful Paranoia of Total Control"},{"content":" Breaking the Mold in Vascular Access: Why Healthcare Needs a Gut Check I’m over the “innovation” talk in healthcare. Really. We’re all so busy positioning ourselves as the next big tech company with our “custom AI” projects, yet CLABSIs—central line-associated bloodstream infections—still run rampant across the country. Every professional I’ve met in healthcare has this bizarre inertia: they’re quick to ask but excruciatingly slow to spend, like they’re clinging to the hope that maybe if they wait just long enough, their problems will solve themselves. Spoiler alert: they won’t.\nLet’s call it what it is. The healthcare system—especially in vascular access—is resistant, slow, and more comfortable hiding behind research than actually doing the work to make change. And for what? To be on one more academic paper about hemolysis in goats or a novel \u0026ldquo;non-inferiority\u0026rdquo; study that accomplishes exactly nothing? If you ask me, that’s not progress. That’s just bureaucratic masturbation.\nHealthcare’s Hype Obsession: AI Without Direction Now don’t get me wrong. I believe in tech. Hell, I’m building technology myself because I genuinely believe in its potential. But the way healthcare fetishizes tech is downright laughable. We’re so busy trying to add an AI module to every minor task, thinking we’re on the brink of some groundbreaking discovery. Yet nobody’s stopping to ask: does this actually do anything?\nWe’ve seen this story before. Excel transformed data handling in the 90s. And now, with language models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), we have tools that could streamline the way information flows in healthcare. We could reduce redundancies, cut back on misinformation, maybe even start solving real problems. But no, we’re too busy focusing on buzzwords, trying to build “proprietary solutions” with no real objective other than being able to say, “Yes, we have AI.”\nLet’s be clear: if you’re using AI because everyone else is, that’s not innovation. That’s herd mentality. And it’s one of the biggest reasons why healthcare innovation fails before it even gets off the ground. Don’t expect tech to be a savior if you’re not even clear on what it’s saving.\nStop Worshipping Obstacles: Move Fast and Fail Forward The phrase “fail forward” gets tossed around a lot these days, but the truth is, we’re still too scared to fail—especially in healthcare. Everyone’s so careful, so cautious. We’d rather watch issues like CLABSI spread because no one’s willing to take a risk, maybe test out an unproven solution, iterate, and make improvements over time. The goal isn’t to be perfect on the first try; the goal is to be better today than we were yesterday.\nWe seem to forget that failure is a given in any real innovation. You’re going to mess up; I’m going to mess up; everyone is going to mess up. The difference between success and stagnation is in who can keep moving despite the failure. Sitting around and thinking about what could go wrong is paralyzing, and it’s exactly why healthcare remains this behemoth of red tape and sloth. At some point, you have to get off your ass, put something out there, and fix it as you go. That’s how everything that has ever improved actually improved.\nGenuine Innovation Isn’t Safe—And That’s the Point Think about any real leap forward in history. Did it happen because everyone sat around a conference table playing it safe? No. It happened because someone got sick of waiting, someone got pissed off enough to do something radical. But in healthcare, genuine innovation is treated like it’s too dangerous, like we should stick to what we know—even if it doesn’t work.\nThat’s where I see the issue: the people in charge of making change are the same people who are perfectly content with things staying the same. These people are more interested in protecting the system than in challenging it. They’d rather publish a paper on an obscure aspect of vascular access that’ll impress their peers at the next conference than actually reduce infection rates. Innovation is for the brave, for the impatient, for the people willing to look at a wall and think, “Screw it. I’m going through.”\nHealthcare needs a gut check—a reminder that it’s here for people, not protocols. If something isn’t working, we don’t need another five-year study to tell us that. We need to act, and we need to be willing to fail publicly, fail loudly, and then get right back to work.\nThe “Next Big Thing” Mentality is a Smokescreen It’s not the obsession with AI and fancy tech. It’s the obsession with being the “next big thing,” with trying to make some grand, sweeping change like handling a merger between two hospital networks when we can’t even get the basics right. Vascular access, for instance—why are we still struggling with outdated practices that don’t work? Why are infection rates still a problem? Why are we pretending like these issues need revolutionary solutions when we haven’t even mastered the basic, effective protocols? Some of these nurses are learning more on TikTok than they are from their own organization.\nThe answer is simple: we’re more interested in looking good than in actually being good. So here we are, one healthcare startup after another claiming to be “disruptive” while taking on absolutely zero risk. We’re just riding the coattails of the last buzzword, too scared to step outside the line.\nYou can’t claim you’re “changing the industry” if you’re unwilling to make waves. Real change is disruptive, uncomfortable, and yeah—it’s going to piss some people off. But if you’re not ready to upset a few people along the way, what are you even doing here?\nBreak the Mold: Healthcare Doesn’t Have Time to Play It Safe At the end of the day, healthcare is too important to us to be this slow to move. Patients are too important to be pushed aside in favor of keeping things comfortable and familiar. If you’re in a position to make change, you have a responsibility to do it now, not five years from now. And you need to be ready to fail, to mess it up, and to keep moving anyway.\nSo what’s it going to be? Are we going to keep tiptoeing around, hiding behind academic papers and committees, or are we actually going to do the work? Are we going to let the obstacles stop us, or are we going to bulldoze right through them?\nIf you’re not here to break the mold, to try something different, to screw up, and to keep pushing forward, then maybe healthcare isn’t the right field for you. Because this industry doesn’t have time for hesitation anymore. We need risk-takers, rule-breakers, and people who don’t care if their name’s on the paper—as long as the patient gets what they need.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/healthcare-slow-moving-carcass/","summary":"Breaking through healthcare\u0026rsquo;s bureaucratic inertia: why the industry needs to stop fetishizing AI and start solving actual clinical problems.","title":"Healthcare is a Slow Moving Carcass"},{"content":"Why We\u0026rsquo;re Building IntracavOS: Real Talk About Healthcare AI Look, let\u0026rsquo;s cut through the BS - healthcare AI is a mess. Everyone\u0026rsquo;s rushing to slap an LLM onto their product and call it \u0026ldquo;revolutionary,\u0026rdquo; but nobody\u0026rsquo;s talking about the elephant in the room: most of these solutions are held together with duct tape and prayers. At Intracav AI, we\u0026rsquo;re doing something different, and I\u0026rsquo;m going to tell you exactly why our approach is going to eat everyone else\u0026rsquo;s lunch.\nThe Problem with Healthcare AI Here\u0026rsquo;s what nobody wants to admit: deploying AI in healthcare is a nightmare. You\u0026rsquo;ve got HIPAA breathing down your neck, hospitals running ancient infrastructure, and tech stacks that look like they were designed by a committee of caffeinated raccoons. And don\u0026rsquo;t even get me started on the \u0026ldquo;AI companies\u0026rdquo; that can\u0026rsquo;t even reproduce their own model training environments consistently.\nWhy We Chose NixOS (And Why You Should Care) I\u0026rsquo;m going to say something controversial: your choice of operating system matters more than your choice of AI model. Yeah, I said it. Fight me.\nWe built IntracavOS on NixOS because, frankly, we\u0026rsquo;re tired of the \u0026ldquo;it works on my machine\u0026rdquo; nonsense. When you\u0026rsquo;re dealing with healthcare data and AI models that could literally affect patient outcomes, you can\u0026rsquo;t afford to play fast and loose with your infrastructure.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what NixOS gives us that others can\u0026rsquo;t:\nZero configuration drift. None. What works in development works in production, period. Version control for your entire system. Rollbacks that actually work. The ability to deploy the same stack anywhere - cloud, on-prem, your mom\u0026rsquo;s basement - doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. It just works. The Stack: Because Architecture Matters Let me break this down for you. IntracavOS isn\u0026rsquo;t just some hastily cobbled-together stack of trendy tech. We\u0026rsquo;ve built this thing like a precision instrument, with four main components:\nBase Instance: Think of this as mission control. It\u0026rsquo;s the brain that keeps everything running smooth. Data Processing Pipeline: Because garbage in = garbage out, and we\u0026rsquo;re not about to feed our models junk data. LLM Training Pipeline: Where the magic happens. And by magic, I mean rigorous, reproducible model training. Deployment Pipeline: Because what good is a model if you can\u0026rsquo;t deploy it reliably? The Real Secret Sauce: Modularity Here\u0026rsquo;s where it gets interesting. Each piece of IntracavOS is its own module. Why? Because monoliths are for dinosaurs, and we\u0026rsquo;re not trying to build the next healthcare extinction event.\nWant to scale up your data processing but keep training lean? Cool. Need to run inference on-prem but train in the cloud? No problem. It\u0026rsquo;s like LEGO for healthcare AI, except instead of stepping on it painfully in the middle of the night, you\u0026rsquo;re building something that actually works.\nSecurity: Because \u0026ldquo;Move Fast and Break Things\u0026rdquo; Doesn\u0026rsquo;t Work in Healthcare Let\u0026rsquo;s be real - if you\u0026rsquo;re not paranoid about security in healthcare, you\u0026rsquo;re doing it wrong. Our security isn\u0026rsquo;t just a checkbox on a compliance form; it\u0026rsquo;s built into every level of the stack:\nEverything\u0026rsquo;s encrypted. Not just \u0026ldquo;we use HTTPS\u0026rdquo; encrypted - we\u0026rsquo;re talking serious, NSA-would-be-proud level encryption. Role-based access that actually makes sense. Audit logs that would make your compliance officer weep tears of joy. The Future: Why This Actually Matters Look, I\u0026rsquo;m not here to sell you some utopian vision of healthcare AI. What I am saying is that we\u0026rsquo;re building something that actually solves real problems. We\u0026rsquo;re making it possible to:\nDeploy healthcare AI without losing sleep over compliance Scale without breaking the bank Iterate without breaking everything Here\u0026rsquo;s the Deal IntracavOS isn\u0026rsquo;t perfect - no system is. But we\u0026rsquo;re building something that actually addresses the real problems in healthcare AI deployment, not just the sexy ones that look good in pitch decks.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re building healthcare AI and you\u0026rsquo;re not thinking about reproducibility, scalability, and security from day one, you\u0026rsquo;re already behind. The good news? We\u0026rsquo;ve done the heavy lifting. The better news? We\u0026rsquo;re open to contributions.\nWant to Get Involved? We\u0026rsquo;re not just another closed-source corporate project. If you\u0026rsquo;re smart and you\u0026rsquo;ve got ideas, we want to hear them. Fork the repo, submit PRs, or just star us on GitHub to stroke my ego. Either way, we\u0026rsquo;re building something important here, and we\u0026rsquo;re doing it right.\nBecause at the end of the day, this isn\u0026rsquo;t just about building better AI - it\u0026rsquo;s about building AI that healthcare can actually trust and use. And if that doesn\u0026rsquo;t get you excited, you might be in the wrong industry.\nP.S. Yes, we really did build this whole thing on NixOS. No, we\u0026rsquo;re not crazy. We\u0026rsquo;re just right.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/introducing-intracavos/","summary":"Discover how IntracavOS solves the infrastructure nightmare in healthcare AI with NixOS-based reproducible deployments, enterprise security, and modular architecture.","title":"Introducing IntracavOS"},{"content":"Deep Dive Blood Draws and Hemolysis Follow along Intracav Chat and interact with it yourself with this link\nCVR (Catheter to Vein Ratio). The Optimal ratio is \u0026lt;45%.\nThe Physics and Math Alright, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about hemolysis but in this piece we’ll focus the context on blood draws, lab draws, blood samples, and lab samples. There’s a lot of contradicting anecdotes and confusion around which is the best device or technique to use. So let\u0026rsquo;s deep dive into the physics and biochemistry for this one. LET\u0026rsquo;S GOOO!!! First we’ll dive into the physics and then we’ll go into the biochemistry specifically around the red blood cells.\nFirst off which physics? Fluid dynamics specifically. But let\u0026rsquo;s narrow it down even further to what I think are the 4 major components to our everyday practice and then we’ll hyperfocus on blood draws. Here are the 4 physics laws and principles we need to understand fully before we can make any conclusions on best practice. Hagen–Poiseuille’s Law, Bernoulli, Venturi, and Cavitation. Let’s start with the most complex: Here’s Poiseuille’s Law equation:\nwhere\nΔp is the pressure difference between the two ends,\nL is the length of pipe,\nμ is the dynamic viscosity,\nQ is the volumetric flow rate,\nR is the pipe radius,\nA is the cross-sectional area of pipe.\nNow I know that even this equation is flawed because we are not taking into account the Darcy–Weisbach equation… Let’s hold off on that for now and just focus on Poiseuille’s Law.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s disregard the “Viscosity” because it’s something we cannot change during blood draw (blood aspiration)(Lab draw). Let’s also disregard “Area” since radius is an easier metric to mentally convert with our known gauge and french catheter sizes. And then of course for the context of blood draw let\u0026rsquo;s also disregard “Length” in Poiseuille’s equation we don’t have much control over that either.\nSo now let\u0026rsquo;s just look at the Delta p, Q, and R. IMO these are the most easily influenced by our day to day decisions in what we do. So let’s start with Delta p. This is the pressure affected by all the other variables and ultimately affects the red blood cells. Negative pressure being the critical factor that hemolyzes our blood samples.\nLOOK AT THE RADIUS, what do you see next to it on the top right corner of that “R”?\nIt’s an EXPONENT of 4! That is more than just 400% of R. That is R to the POWER of 4. If you remember back in grade school exponents have a SIGNIFICANTLY higher effect.\nSo for every change in radius there is a HUGE jump in the effect that the gauge size has on the pressure and flowrate. So a change of RADIUS from a 22g to a 20g catheter does not affect the pressure by 2x of “gauge”… Its effect is WAAAAY more. Soak that in for a few minutes before moving on.\nNow the other variable we significantly influence in our day-to-day practice is the “Q” in this equation, representing Volumetric Flow Rate. “Q” in my opinion is THE MOST important variable and the most controllable. This is how hard we flush or aspirate = “Human Effort”. So to summarize; the catheter and vein RADIUS we choose, to intervene (insert) (draw blood) from, has a significant influence on the outcome of our interventions. In my opinion the “Q” is the keystone. It’s the most controllable by the clinician and the most range of influence but it’s THE MOST UNKNOWN. We as clinicians who act everyday on the most influential part of this physics LAW, have the LEAST amount of knowledge on it. When’s the last time you measured the volumetric flow rate of your flush or aspiration? Fine, let’s make it more easily measurable; When was the last time you knew the psi of how hard you flush or aspirate? The most influential variable and we NEVER measure it… And in our infinite wisdom we adjust our flowrate by telling each other “flush hard”, “less hard”, “not so hard”, or “niiiiiiice and easy”. Unquantified, subjective, and qualitative feedback. This is the wrong way to pass down the skill to the next generation of highly trained clinicians. So let’s take one more step in breaking the cycle of “catheter abuse” by elevating our understanding of the physics behind our interventions, by understanding the “WHY”. Let\u0026rsquo;s move onto the main reason why we’re here, CAVITATION.\nIt’s when the red blood cells experience so much negative pressure that the blood cells either rupture, structurally compromise, or the contents of the red blood cell are pulled out of the membranes and into the extracellular space. Here’s what leaks out of the RBC’s (Red Blood Cells) and will result in falsely elevated lab values:\nHemoglobin, Potassium, Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH), Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), Various Enzymes, Bilirubin, Iron, and Membrane Phospholipids.\nEvery amount of negative pressure starts to hemolyze blood but there are factors that will accelerate and skyrocket the number of cells and the rate we hemolyze for example:\n\u0026gt; -4 psi dramatically increases hemolysis\nOur human effort when aspirating with syringes The vacutainers and the amount of negative pressure The longer we HOLD negative pressure the more we hemolyze.\nThe longer we hold that neg pressure with the syringe, the more we hemolyze. The longer we have the vacutainers partially filled without venting the tube, the more we hemolyze The more time we expose blood samples to air, in itself, does not hemolyze blood but it weakens the RBC to be more susceptible to hemolysis later in the study process when it undergoes pressure changes.\nKeeping the tube top open for too long Setting aside blood filled syringe Less than 5 minutes is ideal More than 10 min is a high risk of failure Remember, our red blood cells’ homeostatic environment is under pressure inside of our vessels all the time. So when we take it out of its homeostatic pressurized environment, theoretically it’s unbalanced and compromises structural integrity of the red blood cells.\nSo now that we’ve addressed PSI and concluded that the least amount of psi the better and the least amount of time exposed to that Delta p is better…. Let\u0026rsquo;s move onto “R”\n“R” being a denominator indicates the catheter diameter size has an exponentially inverse correlation with pressure. Meaning; the larger the gauge of the catheter the less pressure we will output. This means the larger the catheter the faster we can pull blood without hemolyzing the sample. That’s great news!\u0026hellip;. Right?! Doesn’t that mean the larger the better? Yes! And NO! Yes, it’s better if we are only taking into account the diameter of the catheter however we need to take into account CVR (Catheter to Vein Ratio). This means if the catheter and syringe is larger in an APPROPRIATE CVR vein, there will be enough blood flowing around the catheter and toward the tip without hemolytic negative pressure effects. HOWEVER, if the catheter is so large that it chokes the veins, preventing blood flow, decreasing the pressure at the tip of the catheter we will increase the negative pressure at that site and inside of the vein, catheter, syringe, or tube. This will more likely hemolyze, cavitate the blood cells. So if the catheter is too big for the vein it will more likely hemolyze the blood. This is why bigger isn’t always better. CVR needs to be taken into account.\nBut let\u0026rsquo;s say it’s already in there and we can’t just replace it with a smaller or larger catheter. What else can we change or adjust in our practice? The diameter of the syringe and the diameter of the vein (When possible)!\nThe diameter of the vein can be increased by preventing backflow of the blood with a tourniquet or placing the potential insertion site and lowering it so gravity will help slow down the flow back to the heart. Be cautious with this technique. Although it will hyperinflate the vein it can also hyper concentrate the contents of whole blood which will result in incorrect results. Even after releasing the tourniquet for 60 seconds before aspirating is not enough. We’ll deep dive on that later.\nSo the diameter of the syringes need to also be taken into account. Does that mean the larger the syringe the less pressure we’re going to induce? Again yes and definitely NO! The larger the diameter of the syringe the more difficult it is to control “Q”, flowrate. This is because the larger diameter of the syringe pulls more surface area into the barrel of the syringe affecting more volume movement with less syringe plunger change in distance. It takes more effort to control that large surface area that is pushing and pulling more volume. The larger the diameter of the syringe, the harder it is for the clinicians to pull or push with less or more pressure. The larger the diameter syringes have a smaller range of pressure it can inflict with less effort and it takes more effort to reach outside of that range of pressure. The smaller diameter syringes it is easier to inflict a wider range of pressure starting from 0 psi. [Graph exaggerated to show concept. The pressure metrics also apply to both negative and positive]\nThis means that the syringe sizes we use also influence the effort required to achieve the desired amount of negative pressure exerted on the red blood cells\nBigger is better if the CVR is optimal \u0026lt;45%. But bigger is worse as the CVR increases.\nThere is a crucial variable that significantly distinguishes the hemolysis outcome between vacutainers and syringe blood draw. TIME. This is why we have such better results with 10ml large diameter syringe blood draws, than we do with 3ml small diameter syringe. We can decide to stop pulling and normalize the pressure and wait for the vein to fill back up with blood at the tip of the catheter. This will repressurize that part of the vein with more blood, but it requires TIME. The “Pull Pause” method will apply less TIME with negative pressure applied to the red blood cells. Unfortunately the vacutainers WILL hold that negative pressure forever… or at least until the pressure inside the tube is normalized by the clinician. So, the best thing to do is fill the entire tube COMPLETELY with the blood sample, Release the negative pressure by popping the top and immediately putting the top back on or allowing air to flow into the tubing while the top is still punctured with the needle. Normalize that pressure sooner than later to reduce hemolysis.\nTECHNIQUES Problem: Shaking the tubes aggressively will hemolyze the blood d/t mechanical trauma.\nSolution: Don’t shake it. Problem: The blood initially hitting the bottom of the tube will also induce mechanical trauma. Trauma caused by dropping the tubes or rough handling. Solution: Angle the needle puncturing the tube so that the blood will roll down the side of the tube Solution: Invert tube upside down so that the bottom of the tube is facing up so blood will fall gently back down. Solution: Be gentle when handling the tubes. Don’t throw them if you’re not going to catch them. The Problem: If vacutainers are partially filled, the continuous negative pressure will hemolyze the blood. Solution: Fill the entire tube COMPLETELY with the blood sample. Solution: Vent the negative pressure by popping the top or allowing air to fill through the needle. Solution: Allowing air to flow into the tubing while the top is still punctured with the needle. Problem: If vacutainers are partially filled, the improper ratio of preservatives and blood concentration could hemolyze the sample Solution: Fill the tubes to recommended capacity. Solution: Aspirate blood into smaller capacity tubes, ie pediatric/NICU/microtainers tubes Problem: If the initial draw with vacutainer is too slow or stops, the sustained negative pressure will hemolyze the sample. Solution: Change to syringe draw system. If it fails to draw from a large diameter syringe, reattempt with thinner syringe. Solution: Pull Pause Method - Pull gently to move blood into syringe then release tension to normalize pressure and allow for the veins to refill with blood at the tip of the catheter/needle. Repeat as necessary to obtain enough blood samples. Problem: If the tourniquet is applied for too long it will inappropriately hemoconentrate at the puncture site resulting in falsely elevated results. Solution: Don’t use tourniquet Solution: Apply the tourniquet as far up away from the insertion site as possible Solution: Tightness will need to be adjusted depending on edema, obesity, paint tolerance. Objective is to slow down the blood flow back to the heart and re-inflate the vein for aspiration. Problem: Catheter tip may be up against a sharp turned vein, a valve, a thrombi, or smaller diameter vein. Solution: Pulling out the PIV 0.25cm - 1cm may clear your catheter/needle tip away from the obstruction. Solution: If the catheter is a CVC, attempt to reposition the patient to move the catheter tip away from obstruction. All ranges of motion may be required. Solution: Declotting procedure may be required to obtain proper patency before further attempting blood draw. Solution: For CVC the last hail mary attempt should be to pull back the catheter 0.5cm - 3 cm. Always double check catheter tip placement after this technique. Problem: Delay in testing can also contribute to hemolysis as the RBC’s are not in their homeostatic environment afflicted by the lesser pressure atmospheric environment. Although it may not hemolyze due to atmospheric pressure, the longer exposure to ATM pressure will weaken the cells making it vulnerable later in the study process. Solution: Send the blood to lab asap Problem: Slow blood draw means that the vein at the tip of the needle/catheter is not filled quickly enough with blood. Solution: Have the patient dangle their arm down for a few minutes before you get started. Use gravity to speed up filling that venous puncture site with blood to aspirate with. Problem: Stress from the patient can induce vasospasms, which will obstruct the blood flow at the tip of the catheter and decrease reservoir of blood. Solution: Use therapeutic calming techniques to reduce patient anxiety Problem: Temperature changes can also contribute to hemolysis due to protein degradation and increased enzyme activity. Solution: (20-25°C or 68-77°F), slightly cooler conditions are generally better for reducing hemolysis. Keep away from heat sources. Problem: Blood exposure to rubbing alcohol Solution: Wait for the chemicals to completely dry before puncture. Discussion *I know there’s studies out there that claim that the catheter size is what causes hemolysis, they’re right and they’re so wrong. They have partial data to prove it, and it doesn’t correlate with anecdotes. “If the data and anecdotes don’t line up, re-evaluate the data”, Jeff Bezos.\nI keep hearing “22g and smaller catheters are causing hemolysis, don’t draw blood from them” ok so we can’t use the 22g catheters but we can use the 23 gauge butterfly? What about our pediatric patients? What about the blood draw from initial stick, how come they’re allowed but nothing after? Then it must NOT be the catheter size but something else. That’s why we’re here. To re-evaluate the data so we can find solutions to prevent unnecessary trauma to the patient’s body.\nI hear people say “why fix what ain’t broke”. Well… the deeper I dive into this thing called Vascular Access, the more broken I’m finding our standard practice to be. 50% of PIVC fail before end of treatment. Increased vein trauma and long term venous depletion due to multiple venipunctures or improper aspiration techniques throughout the hospital stay, even more so with hemolyzed lab samples. Iatrogenic anemia we like to chase after with blood transfusion.\nPoor practice has been so commonplace that we go after those who call out the crappy practice with pitchforks and torches. “You don’t know what it’s like in my hospital?!”, “We don’t have the money to invest in new equipment or training?!”, “Who’s going to pay for that?!”, “I don’t have time for that!”. These are just excuses and acceptance of poor practice. It’s a great explanation… still a shitty excuse we use to continue to torture our patients unnecessarily. Let’s break the cycle of abuse and continue to pursue better care, skills, and knowledge for our patients. You’re right, we don’t owe them anything but it’s the right thing to do.\nReferences:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3662481/\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19426141/\nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15744\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25871866/\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/policies/blood-draws-hemolysis-prevention/","summary":"Deep dive into hemolysis prevention in blood draws, exploring the physics of cavitation, optimal CVR ratios, and clinical best practices for maintaining sample integrity.","title":"Blood Draws and Hemolysis: Physics, Biochemistry, and Best Practices"},{"content":"Cortisol Levels in Hospital Staff and Work Efficiency: A Critical Clinical Analysis Executive Summary: The Hidden Crisis in Healthcare Excellence We\u0026rsquo;re confronting an invisible enemy in our hospitals—one that silently undermines clinical performance, compromises patient safety, and devastates our healthcare workforce.
