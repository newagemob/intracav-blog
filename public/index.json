It explains that healthcare workers face unique stressors such as high-stakes patient care, excessive workloads, and lack of institutional support, which can lead to chronically elevated cortisol and subsequent health issues including anxiety, depression, cognitive impairment, and cardiovascular problems. These effects ultimately reduce work efficiency and can compromise patient safety. The article reviews research on cortisol patterns in emergency care providers, discusses how the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these challenges, and offers strategies for managing cortisol levels through lifestyle modifications (exercise, sleep hygiene), stress management techniques (mindfulness, CBT), organizational changes (workload management, flexibility), and when necessary, medical interventions. It concludes by urging healthcare organizations to prioritize staff well-being through transparent, supportive management practices to maintain both employee health and quality patient care.","section":"blog","title":"Cortisol Levels in Hospital Staff and Work Efficiency","url":"/blog/cortisol-levels-in-hospital-staff-and-work-efficiency/"},{"content":"1. Core Principles of Vascular Care The administration of infusion therapy and the management of vascular access devices (VADs) must be governed by a structured hierarchy of safety and ethics. These principles apply to all access types, including peripheral, central, intraosseous, subcutaneous, and epidural/intrathecal routes.\nRegulatory Alignment: Clinicians must adhere to the specific legislative and regulatory framework of their jurisdiction (national, state, or provincial).
